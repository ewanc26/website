# Publication to Slug Mapping
# Configure your publication slugs in src/lib/config/slugs.ts
# This allows you to access publications via friendly URLs like /blog, /notes, etc.
# Example: { slug: 'blog', publicationRkey: '3m3x4bgbsh22k' }
# 
# Each publication in Leaflet can have its own base_path configured, which will be
# automatically used when redirecting. If no base_path is set, the system falls back
# to the standard Leaflet URL format (https://leaflet.pub/lish/{did}/{rkey}).

# If you have `com.whtwnd.blog.entry` records in your AT Protocol
# repository, they will also be fetched and displayed on your website
# alongside your Leaflet posts.
# The WhiteWind posts are always linked to using the following format:
# https://whtwnd.com/[did]/[rkey].

# Slingshot Configuration (optional)
# Local Slingshot instance for development - primary source for AT Protocol data
# Set to your local Slingshot instance URL (default: http://localhost:3000)
# Leave empty to skip local Slingshot and use public Slingshot directly
PUBLIC_LOCAL_SLINGSHOT_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Public Slingshot instance - fallback if local is unavailable
# Default: https://slingshot.microcosm.blue
PUBLIC_SLINGSHOT_URL="https://slingshot.microcosm.blue"
