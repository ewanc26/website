This was a surprise.

I now have a secondary [Fediverse](https://fediverse.info) account, ***on my own self-hosted server!***

Yep, at [gts.ewancroft.uk](https://gts.ewancroft.uk), which runs [GoToSocial](https://gotosocial.org/) as a [Yunohost](https://yunohost.org) application.

Do be aware that given it's *self-hosted*, it may not be online 24/7. In that case, I would be online at [`@ewan@infosec.town`](https://infosec.town/@ewan) rather than [`@ewan@gts.ewancroft.uk`](https://gts.ewancroft.uk/@ewan).

I am eventually planning on moving the server onto a Raspberry Pi 4B, but it works well right now. *Slightly* slow, but fast enough.

Anyway, that's all. I'm happy.
