Yep.

I decided to make the jump since I wanted to branch out from solely Ubuntu-based distributions, and [Fedora (Workstation)](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/) seemed like a good choice.

It's a part of the [Red Hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux) lineage, so it has a different base from Ubuntu and its derivatives, which are based on [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian) instead. I have looked into it around the internet and it seems to be one of the most stable distros.

As far as I can tell, right now, the only real difference is the use of the [`DNF`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNF_(software)) package manager rather than [`APT`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)). This doesn't change much, and I am still able to use the [homebrew package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(package_manager)) alongside it.
