I find it funny that people usually take “were-” of werewolf and slap it on anything vaguely meant to be lycanthropic.

they don't realise that “were-” comes from [“ƿer” (”wer”)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Were) in Old English, it is a term for an adult male human.

In essence, a direct translation of “ƿerƿulf” from OE to Modern English would be “wolfman,” which follows similar conventions as other languages:

*Spanish* - “Hombre lobo”

*Welsh* - “Blaidd dyn”

*French* - “Loup garou” (outlier as it literally means “Wolf werewolf.” Recursion? &#128514;)

*Greek* - “λυκάνθρωπος” (”lykánthropos,” where English gets the loanword “lycanthropy” and its derivatives from)

Basically, if people are going to be using “were-”, it should be targeting [therianthropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therianthropy) in general.

Stupid that I know the etymology *like it would ever change how people use it.*
