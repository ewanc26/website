Hm.

Didn't think I'd move from Linux, but *here we are.*

Basically, I'm solely going to use Windows for gaming. I was frustrated with [Proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_(software)) (at least on [my not-for-gaming laptop](https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-uk/inspiron-15-3501-laptop/inspiron-3501-setup-and-specifications/specifications-of-inspiron-3501?guid=guid-7c9f07ce-626e-44ca-be3a-a1fb036413f9&lang=en-us)) so my best shot is probably running these Steam games (and annoyingly the EA App? fucking EA...) natively on Windows.

I guess one benifit is having iCloud sync possible again.
