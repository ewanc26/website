Most people ***really*** don't realise the actual logistics of a lycanthropic curse, in the modern age, do they?

It is literally in the name, a *curse*, but modern fiction, particularly post-millennium, has romanticised it[^1] to the point that the original *horror* has been quite often lost. I'm not, by any means, saying that any of the works of fiction are particularly *wrong*, per se, as it is just that, speculatory fiction, but it *did* start as something unwanted.

Let's look at how things have shifted, pun intended.

## Historical Depictions

### The Myth of Lycaon

As most might expect if they, like myself, have looked at basically *any* lycanthropic fiction pieces, the [Arcadian King Lycaon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycaon_(king_of_Arcadia)) is sure to pop up in mention or reference.

I should know, I did a poem with a stanza[^2] referencing him, and by proxy, referring to Zeus:

```plaintext
You abandoned us, faux God.
You cursed Lycaon,
You cursed us...
The human doesn't understand,
We only want to be free...
```

The myth of Lycaon is among the oldest in Western writings[^3] to depict werewolves as we would, somewhat, recognise them today.

![Zeus turning Lycaon into a wolf; engraving by Hendrik Goltzius.](/images/werewolf-depictions/Lycaon_Transformed_into_a_Wolf_LACMA_M.71.76.9.jpg 'Zeus turning Lycaon into a wolf; engraving by Hendrik Goltzius.')

(image from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lycaon_Transformed_into_a_Wolf_LACMA_M.71.76.9.jpg))

The myth is widely accepted to be one of the origins of modern-day depictions of lycanthropy and as such, is pretty famous.

The Lycaon myth weaves a profound influence on contemporary portrayals of werewolves, leaving an indelible mark that extends beyond the mere concept of human-to-wolf transformation. Its resonance is felt in various facets, shaping the narratives of lycanthropy in modern fiction.

Firstly, the Curse Motif stands as a prominent pillar. Lycaon's metamorphosis into a beast acts as a cautionary tale, underscoring the repercussions of violating divine laws. This narrative framework lays the foundation for the tragic stories of cursed individuals grappling with their monstrous nature in present-day fiction, evident in characters like Scott Howard from "Teen Wolf" or the conflicted protagonist, David Kessler, in "An American Werewolf in London."

The Savage Within, another thematic thread, taps into a primal fear dwelling within humanity—the untamed wilderness lurking in the shadows. Lycaon's descent into savagery mirrors the potential for individuals to succumb to their baser instincts. This primal theme resonates in contemporary stories such as The Twilight Saga, where werewolves embody both primal urges and a profound connection to the natural world.

Furthermore, the myth raises questions about Morality and Transformation. Does Lycaon's transformation serve as a punishment for wickedness, or does it unveil a pre-existing darkness within him? This ambiguity fuels modern narratives that delve into the intricate relationship between identity, morality, and the inner beast, as witnessed in shows like True Blood and Hemlock Grove.

The Price of Hospitality adds a layer of cautionary morality to the werewolf myth. Zeus' wrath is triggered by Lycaon's violation of guest-host rights, emphasizing the sacred tenet in Greek culture. This element injects a cautionary note into the werewolf narrative, suggesting that transgressing social norms and abusing hospitality can have dire consequences. This theme finds echoes in contemporary stories where werewolves often serve as protectors of community and upholders of tradition.

Finally, beyond monstrosity, the Lycaon myth hints at nuance. While Lycaon faces Zeus' wrath, his sons are spared, implying that transformation isn't inherently evil. This opens the door for modern interpretations that paint the werewolf as a complex figure capable of both good and evil, exemplified in characters like Remus Lupin from the Harry Potter series. The myth, like a spectral thread, weaves through the fabric of contemporary lycanthropic tales, leaving an enduring imprint on our understanding of this mythical creature.

All this considered, the Greek legend is *not*, by any means, the sole influence of the modern depiction of the ability.

### The Ossory Werewolves

Much of the mysticism of these wolfmen is down to various stories, such as the Werewolves of Ossory, originating as early as 1200 C.E.

![Depiction of the Werewolves of Ossory, from Topographia Hibernica by Gerald of Wales, c. 1200](/images/werewolf-depictions/Werewolves_of_Ossory.png 'Depiction of the Werewolves of Ossory, from Topographia Hibernica by Gerald of Wales, c. 1200')

(image from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Werewolves_of_Ossory.png))

The Ossory Werewolves are legendary shapeshifters from Irish folklore, specifically associated with the ancient kingdom of Ossory in the southeast of the country. Their origins have two main strands:

1. According to this first legend, the werewolves descended from a mythical warrior named Laignech Fáelad[^4], whose line later gave rise to the kings of Ossory. This suggests a hereditary curse or inherent magical ability within the bloodline.

2. Another strand attributes the transformation to a divine curse placed upon the people of Ossory for their wickedness and defiance, particularly against Saint Patrick during his Christianisation of Ireland[^5]. This framing paints the werewolves as monstrous and deserving of their fate.

The Ossory Werewolves have left their mark on modern portrayals of these creatures in several ways:

- The concept of a cyclical transformation, often tied to specific nights or periods, like the seven-year curse[^4] in some Ossory tales, is echoed in modern werewolf lore.

- Unlike the clear-cut good vs evil narratives of some werewolf stories, the Ossory legends present a more nuanced picture. Some werewolves are cursed and monstrous, while others are simply fulfilling a preordained role or even seeking help. This moral ambiguity adds depth and complexity to modern werewolf characters.

- The association with the wild and untamed nature of wolves, a key element of the Ossory myth, remains a defining characteristic of werewolves in popular culture

## Modern Depictions

### 20th Century

#### 1941's 'The Wolf Man'

![The Wolf Man poster](/images/werewolf-depictions/The_Wolf_Man_poster.jpeg 'The Wolf Man poster')

(image from [here](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034398/?ref_=fn_al_tt_8))

The Wolf Man stands as a pivotal work in the realm of horror cinema, casting an enduring shadow over the portrayal of werewolves in popular culture. Its profound influence has left an indelible mark, shaped the very essence of the werewolf mythos and served as a wellspring of inspiration for contemporary filmmakers and writers.

Key facets of The Wolf Man's impact on modern lycanthropic depictions include:

1. The film's depiction of the werewolf, characterized by an elongated snout, pointed ears, and shaggy fur, has evolved into the archetype of the modern werewolf. Lon Chaney Jr.'s transformative performance, marked by agonizing contortions, remains a benchmark in cinematic history. It also could be coincidental that it looks similar to [hypertrichosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrichosis).

2. The Wolf Man presents a departure from the mindless monster trope, portraying the titular character as a tragic hero ensnared by his own curse. This nuanced archetype, torn between human and animal instincts, has reverberated in werewolf narratives from An American Werewolf in London (1981) to Twilight (2005; book, 2008; film).

3. The film established the full moon as the catalyst for werewolf transformations, a trope ingrained in popular culture despite lacking roots in folklore.

4. The Wolf Man's demise via a silver bullet has become synonymous with werewolves, although its prevalence in modern stories has waned.

5. Exploring identity, duality, and the struggle between good and evil, The Wolf Man paved the way for werewolf stories delving into complex human issues.

Beyond these specific tropes, the film's overarching tone and atmosphere have left an enduring imprint on the werewolf genre. Its dark, gothic visuals, adept use of suspense and melodrama, and exploration of the darker facets of human nature collectively contribute to the enduring portrayal of werewolves in modern media.

While acknowledging The Wolf Man's seminal influence, it's essential to recognise that it's not the sole contributor to shaping contemporary lycanthropic depictions. Other films have also played pivotal roles, weaving a rich tapestry that continues to evolve in the ever-expanding werewolf genre.

#### 1981's 'An American Werewolf in London'

An American Werewolf in London, a monumental force in shaping modern werewolf portrayals, distinctively complements the legacy of The Wolf Man, 40 years after and following its tail, leaving an indelible mark on the genre. Here's how it etched its influence:

John Landis' film spearheaded a revolution in practical effects, notably in Rick Baker's ground-breaking werewolf transformation sequence. This visceral metamorphosis, utilizing prosthetics and stop-motion animation, achieved an unprecedented level of realism and horror, redefining cinematic transformations.

An American Werewolf in London adeptly intertwines horror with dark humour, infusing the narrative with wit and satire. Landis leverages this blend to explore themes of alienation, cultural clashes, and the absurdities of bureaucratic red tape, elevating the werewolf mythos with depth and memorability.

Delving into the character's psyche beyond previous werewolf stories, the film explores David's struggles with accepting his monstrous nature, the guilt over transformations, and the fear of losing his humanity. This added layer of psychological complexity resonates profoundly with audiences.

Unlike traditional monster-hunting narratives, An American Werewolf in London doesn't cast the werewolf against a human hero. Instead, the film focuses on David's journey of understanding and coping with his condition, subverting expectations and infusing the werewolf trope with a tragic dimension.

The film's impact reverberates in numerous werewolf movies that followed, with Teen Wolf (1985) incorporating humour and coming-of-age themes and Dog Soldiers (2002) embracing the action-horror blend. Its influence extends beyond the horror genre, with films like Ginger Snaps (2000) exploring themes of female identity and sexuality through the werewolf lens.

An American Werewolf in London's enduring legacy lies in its innovative special effects, genre-defying blend, and exploration of the human condition within the werewolf myth. Challenging traditional tropes, paved the way for future interpretations, securing its status as a horror comedy classic that continues to inspire filmmakers and captivate audiences.

### Post-Millennium

#### Twilight (book and film series; 2005-2020)

Diverging significantly in tone and style from the classic horror of The Wolf Man and the visceral realism of An American Werewolf in London, the Twilight saga has undeniably etched its imprint on the modern werewolf portrayal, despite its primary focus on vampirism.[^1]

In Twilight, the werewolf myth underwent a profound transformation, infused with a generous dose of teen romance. This narrative shift aimed to broaden the genre's appeal, particularly among young adults. The forbidden love story between Bella Swan and Edward Cullen, a "vegetarian" vampire, redirected attention from monstrous transformations and gory violence to emotional turmoil, internal conflicts, and the intricate complexities of navigating love and desire.

Departing from the ferocious beasts of traditional lore, Twilight's werewolves, led by the brooding Jacob Black, emerged as ripped, tattooed heartthrobs. Possessing a strong sense of loyalty and family, their transformations, while still potent, took on a sleek and controlled aesthetic. Glowing eyes and enhanced physical prowess accompanied these metamorphoses, catering to a new generation drawn to the allure of a "good" monster.

Twilight introduced a sophisticated social structure within the werewolf pack, featuring an alpha leader and stringent behavioural rules. This injected a layer of intrigue and conflict into the narrative, as characters like Jacob grappled with their positions within the pack and the challenges of upholding their responsibilities.

The Twilight series blurred the boundaries between humans and monsters, portraying werewolves not merely as fearsome creatures but as individuals with their desires, vulnerabilities, and moral compasses. This departure from traditional monster narratives provided a nuanced perspective on the werewolf archetype.

The physical transformations in Twilight served as a metaphor for the emotional and social changes teenagers undergo during puberty. Jacob's struggle to control his wolf side mirrored the challenges of navigating identity, fitting in, and finding one's place in the world. This resonated with young readers who saw their own struggles mirrored in the characters' journeys.

While Twilight's influence on the werewolf genre is undeniable, it's crucial to acknowledge that its unique brand of lycanthropy faced criticism for romanticising potentially dangerous creatures and portraying unhealthy relationships. Nevertheless, it significantly broadened the genre's appeal, paving the way for more diverse and nuanced werewolf stories that explore themes beyond traditional monster hunting and teenage angst.

#### Wolf Pack (Book; 2004, TV series; 2023)

Wolf Pack, a 2004 book by Edo van Belkom adapted by Jeff Davis (of [MTV Teen Wolf](https://www.mtv.com/shows/teen-wolf) fame) into the 2023 TV series, has two distinct versions.

Jeff Davis' adaptation takes a refreshing departure from conventional lycanthropic tropes, offering a nuanced and distinctive perspective on the transformative nature of lycanthropy. Here's an exploration of its portrayal:

Found Family Dynamic:
"Wolf Pack" places significant emphasis on the concept of the pack, presenting it not merely as a biological unit but as a chosen family. Bitten teenagers, Everett and Blake, along with Luna, a born werewolf, form a powerful bond that transcends their individual transformations, highlighting the importance of finding family in their lives.

Shared Challenges, Individual Struggles:
While the characters collectively grapple with the challenges posed by lycanthropy, the show intricately portrays their experiences as deeply personal. Everett's battle with anxiety and self-doubt and Blake's confrontation with anger and rebellion showcase the individual struggles within the broader context of their shared condition. Luna, embodying her inherent wolf nature, acts as a bridge between these two worlds.

Lycanthropy as a Metaphor:
Going beyond the physical transformation, "Wolf Pack" delves into the psychological and emotional impact of lycanthropy. The characters confront issues of identity, control, and belonging, providing viewers with a poignant exploration of navigating a world that feels increasingly unfamiliar.

Nuanced Morality - Shades of Gray:
In contrast to conventional portrayals of werewolves as inherently monstrous, "Wolf Pack" introduces a more complex perspective. The characters navigate a moral landscape coloured by fear, loyalty, and self-preservation, blurring the lines between good and evil and challenging traditional dichotomies.

Gender Fluidity in Werewolf Lore:
The show breaks away from the conventional male-centric werewolf narrative by placing Luna, a strong and independent female character, at the forefront. This choice challenges established gender stereotypes within the werewolf lore, adding a refreshing and progressive dimension to the narrative.

Exploration of Trauma and Resilience:
"Wolf Pack" delves into the intricate link between trauma and lycanthropy. The characters' transformations are often triggered by past events, underscoring the show's commitment to emotional depth and character development.

Edo van Belkom's original novel serves as the bedrock for Jeff Davis's adaptation. While sharing core themes of pack dynamics and personal struggles, the book offers a bleaker and more suspenseful portrayal of lycanthropy.

Raw and Swift Transformations:
In contrast to the gradual shifts in the TV adaptation, the book's transformations are swift and agonizing. The characters are overtaken by animalistic urges, losing control over their senses and actions. This raw portrayal underscores the primal force unleashed by the curse.

Predatory Nature and Instinct:
The novel places a greater emphasis on the predatory instincts of the wolves. Hunting becomes an irresistible urge, blurring the lines between humans and animals and adding a layer of danger and unpredictability to the characters' struggles.

Living in Shadows - Paranoia and Isolation:
Characters in the book exist in a perpetual state of paranoia and isolation, fearing exposure and persecution. This constant need for secrecy forces them to live double lives, adding psychological torment to their transformative experiences.

Questioning Humanity - Ethical Implications:
The novel grapples with the ethical implications of lycanthropy, as characters confront their capacity for violence and question their place in the human world. This moral ambiguity adds depth and complexity to their journey.

Strength in Unity Amidst Bleakness:
Despite the grimness, the book offers a glimmer of hope through the power of the pack. Characters find solace and support in each other, forging a bond that transcends their individual struggles, echoing the theme of a found family present in both the book and the TV show.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the journey through the rich tapestry of lycanthropy, from its ancient roots in myths like that of Lycaon to the nuanced and diverse portrayals in modern fiction, reveals a captivating evolution of the werewolf archetype. The exploration of historical depictions, such as the Ossory Werewolves, showcases the multifaceted nature of these mythical creatures, adding layers of complexity that continue to influence contemporary narratives.

The 20th-century cinematic contributions, notably 'The Wolf Man' and 'An American Werewolf in London,' have left an indelible mark on the genre, shaping the visual and emotional language of werewolf tales. The post-millennium shift, exemplified by the 'Twilight' series and 'Wolf Pack,' reflects the genre's adaptability to changing cultural sensibilities, embracing themes beyond traditional horror and delving into the emotional and relational aspects of lycanthropy.

As we navigate through the landscapes of ancient myths, cinematic masterpieces, and modern novels, it becomes evident that the werewolf, once a symbol of terror and curse, has transformed into a complex and multifaceted character. The enduring resonance of these narratives lies not only in their ability to evoke fear but also in their capacity to explore profound themes of identity, morality, and the eternal struggle between humanity and the primal within.

Ultimately, the logistics of lycanthropy may remain a speculative mystery, but the enduring allure of werewolf tales lies in their power to mirror and navigate the complexities of the human condition. Whether it's the ancient howls echoing through mythic forests or the modern-day struggles depicted on screen and in literature, the werewolf continues to captivate our imaginations, reminding us that within the realms of transformation, there exists a profound exploration of what it means to be human.
