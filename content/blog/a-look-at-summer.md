title: A Look at Summer

Summer is fun for a lot of people. This year, though, mine has been... a rollercoaster of emotions.

# So, what happened?

## Pet death

As of last week, our first dog was put to sleep. I won't say much, but it was for the best.

## I got my results! I passed!

I have, as of today, passed my Level 2 IT course and recieved my diploma! Time to go for Level 3 (before I get a job... oh god. I have to update my CV now. &#128517;)

## Successful Arch Linux installation!

Because I've been bored, I decided to try and install [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) using the [install guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) on my laptop.

Needless to say, I was completely out of my depth.

I did try using the [archinstall](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archinstall) automatic installation tool at one point, and while that *worked*, I saw multiple issues pop up post-instsll.

I ended up just following a YouTube guide while cross-referencing the official guide. So, as the meme goes, [I use Arch, btw.](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/btw-i-use-arch)

# Why even talk about this?

I wanted to just update you (whoever even reads my blog. Thank you.) on what's going on with me. Why not? I don't want to always dump an entire blog essay on here, after all.

Anyway, hope you have a good day, night, evening, whatever. 

Thank you again for reading.
