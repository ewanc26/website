Ah, neurodivergence. It's like a language family, one language like German may be its own thing or it's *English*, being three different languages in a trenchcoat. That is to say, everyone's similar, but no one is the same.

I am writing this blog post to do two things:

1. Highlight my own experiences and bring awareness to different ways of thought. Not everyone is what society expects, as we are all running on slightly different operating systems.

2. *Prevent me from passing out because I have an erratic sleep schedule and I am forcing myself to stay awake to fix it.*

On that note, let's get started.

## Imagination

As seen with [my poetry](/poetry), one might assume that I don't have that much creativity. That is *not* the case.

I state that the poetry shown is the selection that I am *comfortable* with showing. As of writing this post, I have 131 poems overall.

### Depths of Poetry

I do not plan on releasing them all, but to give some context on my creative output - I have a poem called "L.O.V.E." about the loss of my grandfather, and a poem called "Instruction" which is literally a poem about ritualistic suicide - carving a [triskelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triskelion) in the bare chest above the heart with a knife after carving out the eyes, all at the dead of night. Better yet is that it's one part of a pair of poems, the before is "Instruction" and the after is "Empty," where the soul of the self-sacrificed talks with [Azrael](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Azrael) before being taken away.

#### Reasoning

I wrote "Empty" first, then "Instruction" afterwards. The reason for such a graphic poetic pair is that, at the time, I was self-isolating. I am not sure why, but between 23rd June and 12th August 2023, I completely shut myself away from the world. By the time I wrote the two poems, on 8th August, I was going stir-crazy. The plot was adapted from a hallucination I had (which is described above.)

### Vivid Imagery

I have a *very* vivid imagination as you probably can tell. It can be a great tool, with me [writing that essay on the logistics of lycanthropy](/logistics-of-lycanthropy) from a single thought - *"I want to hug that murderous monster puppy."* - in example, but it can *definitely* be a disturbance.

I say this, as I have had *lots* of various scenarios vividly depicted that contain my own death. One of them was [already described](#reasoning), but you get the point, I cope with it through my poetry. Not *all* of it, but quite a few.

## Mild Synesthesia and Captioning

Okay... Back to something *much* more light-hearted, how I see the world!

Why are the two things linked in this section? Well, I seem to have a slight form of synesthesia where, for some odd reason, I have specific colours associated with certain languages:

1. English is white

2. Spanish is yellow

3. French is blue

4. German is red

5. Welsh is green

6. Japanese is purple

How does that relate to captioning is that I *"see"* the words as I hear them. If I don't understand them (if English,) they will just appear as what looks to be TV static.

If I don't understand the language, I would "see" `[speaks foreign language]` in place of the "captions."

*It is really hard to explain without sounding insane.*

## Repetition of Actions

~~What's that about the definition of insanity?~~

As with any neurodivergent person, I [stim](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/topics/behaviour/stimming).

In particular, my stims tend to be

1. [Palilalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palilalia). I sometimes just spontaneously repeat words or sounds because they sound nice. (I particularly like /r/ and /É¬/)

2. Gesturing, be it to the beat of my own drums in my own head or music. (I am nodding my head to the beat of my music as I write this!)

3. Talking to myself. I don't know if it's down to chronic loneliness in childhood or my way of processing things but I talk to myself ***a ton.***

## Special Interests

[Special interests](https://www.theautismgroup.org.uk/whats-so-special-about-special-interests/) are fun. I got "bit" by [lycanthropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf) when I was 7 thanks to [Wolfblood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfblood) and I still have that special interest almost 12 years later.

I also adore [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics) and can recognise most national flags thanks to it. And I can read [Russian-variant Cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_alphabet), though I can only do a basic introduction in Russian.

My interest in language is (at least how I like to think it) how I managed to get a 5 (merit; just above a passing grade) in French language GCSE without having any notes or anything in the speaking exam. I just winged it. I later got a 5 in English language for my creative writing and analytical thinking. I have [an example of it](/reviews/american-werewolf-radio-review.md) here too!

Of course, though, they can be and often are a form of coping mecanism. This is not the case for everyone, but it is worth noting. It's one potential reason why [they are sometimes indistinguishable from obsessions](https://www.ambitiousaboutautism.org.uk/information-about-autism/behaviour/special-interests), they can be a way for the person in question to escape reality for a while. That's the case for me with lycanthropy, at least.

### Infodumping

Ah, of course, my favourite part of special interests.

Do you know [those memes where neurodivergent people infodump?](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=neurodivergent+infodump+meme)

We experience immense joy when we can just... well, *dump all our special interest info* on another person. It's a catharsis, a dam that's releasing its reservoir.

In my case, I tend to infodump on my mum. She doesn't mind, but I can tell she's not *really* listening as, typically, it all goes right over her head. She's just happy I'm happy, I suppose.

It's such a special thing for us, because a lot of the time, special interests can be lonely. That's how I feel, at least.

## Conclusion

Despite the struggles, there's beauty in neurodiversity. It's about embracing differences and celebrating the unique perspectives that each individual brings to the table. Whether it's finding comfort in infodumping on a loved one or navigating the world with a colourful palette of language associations, being neurodivergent is an integral part of who I am.

Through awareness and understanding, we can create a more inclusive society where neurodivergent individuals are valued for their contributions and respected for their unique perspectives. So, here's to embracing neurodiversity and celebrating the diverse ways in which we all experience the world.
