***HEY!***

You might've noticed that I have revamped [this site](/).

Yep, I have. Thank you for noticing!

I decided to completely redesign my site because doing it from scratch *was fun* but also tedious and somewhat of a mess. I do still have the old version, but I moved it to a new, privated and archived repository. No one but me can see it now, but it's there just in case I need it.

I have redesigned it using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), with the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) theme in use.

I think it looks nice.

Also, ***new blog!***

I don't know what exactly I'll do with this blog, but I am glad to have one now.

I like that I can use Markdown with it, much better than plaintext.
