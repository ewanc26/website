Things don't always go to plan, huh?

I was planning to, and had, ditch [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks) and fully commit to [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com), but I missed the community I had, despite the faults [I had listed](https://ewancroft.uk/blog/flying-in-the-bluesky/#the-fediverse), seeing as we're all human.

Anyway, I'm still on the AT Protocol through Bluesky, but I'm back to Mastodon too!

***P.S., I know that the account creation date was months ago, shush.***
