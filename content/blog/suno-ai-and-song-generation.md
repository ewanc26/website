title: Suno AI and Song Generation

So, music generation is now a thing, I guess?

I tested [Suno.ai](https://www.suno.ai/) by generating a version of [Lunar Descent](/poetry/lunar-descent) and ***well,*** I have to say it's pretty good.

Kinda freaky though...

## The Prompts

### Lyrical

I created a modified version[^1] of [Lunar Descent](/poetry/lunar-descent) for the AI to work with, made sure it was good for lyrical use:

```plaintext
(Verse 1, scared)
It’s happening, oh God, please hear my plea,
Don’t let him hurt them, don't let it be.
I beg of you, Jehovah, Yahweh, Jesus too,
In these fleeting moments, my final view.

(Chorus, scared)
The fur is rising, oh God, I pray,
Once he takes hold, the Hyde to my Jekyll's sway.
Please don’t let the wolf hurt them tonight,
I’m begging, pleading, in this moonlit light.

(Verse 2, defeatist)
Panting, heaving, barely conscious, I’m here,
As he emerges, filling me with fear.
He is me, I am here, it’s plain to see,
You failed me, "Father," in my agony.

(Bridge, angry)
The wolves praise the Moon, our true master's call,
Bringing what You deny, breaking free from it all.
You cursed Lycaon, cursed us in our plight,
The human doesn't understand, our endless fight.

(Heavy Chorus, angry)
All of us, all of us, trapped in the night,
We can't hunt, can't be free, in our shadowed plight.
You cursed us, dear "Father," in our humanity,
To roam in the shadows of our own insanity.

(Instrumental Outro)
```

### Style

I chose for a darker tone, naturally, so I went for this style prompt:

`acoustic metal, rock, fearful and then angry. clear British male vocals.`

## The Song Itself

I am unsure of my rights in terms of publishing the song on this site as I'm on the Free tier, so you have to believe me anecdotally.

So, what did it produce?

Honestly, I was expecting gibberish of sorts, but no!

Even then, still, the accent wasn't quite right.

Pretty good job overall!

[^1]: I wrote, and still own the lyrics because [Suno does not get the rights to self-written lyrics,](https://suno-ai.notion.site/b72601b96de44e5cacd2cd6baa985448?pvs=25#47fc7b6ad1114a1597903b11c73ade77) as such they fall under [my creative works.](/legalities/licence/#cc-by-nc-nd-40)
