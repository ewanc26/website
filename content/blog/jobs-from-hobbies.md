As most people would know, getting a job is *hard*. I am at the point in life where I have to choose a career for potentially the rest of my life, and that has gotten me thinking; *"Do I want to potentially ruin a hobby of mine that I love, or go into a dead-end job that I hate for the next 50 years of my life?"*

I have not got many options, as I can not do hard labour.

I am currently doing a Software Developer course at my college. I *enjoy* it, sure, but I am dreading having to do it for the rest of my life, being practically shackled down to a keyboard and putting effort into a soulless creation for some faceless company.

Same goes for my poetry. It's a coping mechanism for me, not something I want to make money off of. I started writing poetry at 14-years-old because my mental health was terrible. It, for me, is *extremely* personal and it feel dishonest if I have to make some dirty money off of it.

I just don't know where to go with this stuff, honestly.
