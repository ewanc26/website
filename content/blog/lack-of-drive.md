Recently, I have had a lack of interest in using Python for my programming endevours. Sure, it could be down to me focusing on this website, but I feel like I might atrophy in my Python knowledge if I continue like this.

It's like if I stopped learning spoken languages. I would feel, personally, like I lost *a part of myself*, in a way.

Now, being serious and less dramatic - I find that when I stop doing something for a period of time, I get *really* anxious. When I lost the drive for poetry back in December of last year, I had a full-blown *panic attack* in class, with one of the support staff actually telling me afterwards that "[I] always looked happy and that it caught [them] off guard," I hadn't realised that the drive for poetry comes and goes because I was writing so many, along with the stress of college work as I was falling behind on it at the time.

Yeah...

Schedules and things being in order are what keep me from **falling apart**. *Perks of being neurodivergent, I guess...*

I hope that I can think of some other Python project ideas, I feel like I need to touch up on my knowledge a bit.
