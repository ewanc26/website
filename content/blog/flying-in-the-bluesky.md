Well!

I didn't think I'd be doing a follow-up to a post, but here we are. This is a two-month follow-up to ["Gazing Into the Bluesky."](../gazing-into-the-bluesky)

I have some new thoughts and things I wanted to update the blog on!

## The Fediverse

As you may or may not know, [the Fediverse](https://fediverse.info/) has been my social home since November 2022 after the [Twitter Meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk). ***No more!***

Why is this? There are a few reasons.

### Mastodon and its Toxicity

Mastodon, for what it's worth, is a great platform! I admire and love what a European company can do in the tech world! It has brilliant filtering and self-moderation tools.

The userbase has, sadly, slowly, gnawed me down to the point that I just... can't deal with it anymore. A lot of the time, it's pleasant, but more and more I've seen toxicity drip its way into my feed.

Those on other Fediverse platforms have actually called this part of the Mastodon community the "Mastocels" (a portmanteau of "Mastodon" and ["Incel"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incel)) and honestly, I can see why.

#### Reply Guys

So, you've seen [memes about reply guys](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/reply-guy), right?

Mastodon is *rife* with them. I personally feel like [the perception](https://localghost.dev/blog/twitter-reply-guys-were-bad-but-mastodon-is-no-better/) is right in this regard. I was able to ignore this for a while, but a candle burns out.

## Community

### Curiosity

General curiosity about the community is strong. I'm still finding new interesting people every day, and haven't had a significant bad experience ~~yet~~.

### Furries

A lot of people don't actually realise that [the furry community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom) is very active *in the skies*, as they are in the Fediverse as well. I like to mingle with them as, well, [I am part of it too.](https://bsky.app/profile/ewancroft.uk/post/3kt7skcyn322z)

### Amazing Developer Modesty

The Bluesky core developer team have been very active in the community. It's refreshing from other tech companies, plus, [Jack Dorsey has left the board](https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-says-on-x-that-hes-not-on-the-bluesky-board-anymore-183902317.html) so it's not got some tech billionaire flaunting it like some shiny toy. (***looking at you, Elon.***)

## Wrapping Up

Yeah. I'm no longer really in the Fediverse. If you count [BridgyFed](https://fed.brid.gy/), though, I still am!

My Bluesky account ([@ewancroft.uk](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ofrbh253gwicbkc5nktqepol)) has been bridged over to the Fediverse through BridgyFed at [@ewancroft.uk@bsky.brid.gy](https://fed.brid.gy/bsky/ewancroft.uk).

I have [left a statement](https://infosec.exchange/@ewan/112496305999439269) on my old Mastodon account stating that people can follow me there instead.
