Ah, the joys of Linux.

Being able to completely replace your desktop with a new one, potentially messing up your entire system in the process!

~~That is definitely not anecdotal.~~

This is basically just a post to say that I moved from GNOME 45 to KDE Plasma 5 because I was curious. Pretty good so far!

## My Customisations

KDE Plasma allows for greater customisation of the desktop, so what did I do?

I tried recreating macOS somewhat, since I'm used to it now.

My first attempt was *okay,* but it was a Windows-like style. I didn't like that.

I then found a good macOS-like style that I preferred. It's kind of a mix between the two, really.
