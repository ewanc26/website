I am a British programmer and hobbyist poet.
I was born in Spain, and raised in the UK (I am Anglo-Scottish heritage.)

I enjoy many things, but these are my favourites:

- Writing poetry ([who would've thought!](/poetry))
- [Lycanthropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf) (you can thank CBBC's ["Wolfblood"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfblood) for that)
- Linguistics and language
- Doctor Who
- PlayStation and Nintendo
- Steven Universe
- [BEASTARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastars)  
- [The SCP Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation), with my favorites being [SCP-999](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-999),  
[SCP-001 "When Day Breaks"](https://scpfoundation.fandom.com/wiki/SCP-001_%27%27When_Day_Breaks%27%27), [SCP-4771](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4771) and [SCP-488-JP](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-488-jp).  
- [Analogue Horror](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Analog_Horror), specifically [Kane Pixel's "Backrooms"](https://kane-pixels-backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/Kane_Pixels_Backrooms_Wiki) and [Nexpo's "Liminal Land"](https://www.visitliminalland.net/).

I also like [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4Zc7Jo2VgPDQaDWbS9FIGi?si=69ed6ddd095a4e91)!

I was on major social media, but I've largely stepped away from most in favour of the [Fediverse (OSW)](https://fediverse.info).  
  
You can find me [here](https://infosec.exchange/@ewan) for my main social media presence. [It can be accessed via RSS too](https://infosec.exchange/@ewan.rss)!
