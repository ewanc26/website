I am a British programmer and hobbyist poet.
I was born in Spain, and raised in the UK (I am Anglo-Scottish heritage.)

I enjoy many things, but these are my favourites:

- Writing poetry ([who would've thought!](/poetry))
- [Lycanthropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf) (you can thank CBBC's ["Wolfblood"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfblood) for that)
- Linguistics and language
- Doctor Who
- Gaming
- Steven Universe
- [BEASTARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastars)  
- [The SCP Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation), with my favorites being [SCP-999](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-999),
