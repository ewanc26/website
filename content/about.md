I am a British programmer and hobbyist poet.
I was born in Spain, and raised in the UK (I am Anglo-Scottish heritage.)

I enjoy many things, but these are my favourites:

- Writing poetry ([who would've thought!](/poetry))
- [Lycanthropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf) (you can thank CBBC's ["Wolfblood"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfblood) for that)
- Linguistics and language
- Doctor Who
- PlayStation and Nintendo
- Steven Universe
- [BEASTARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastars)  
- [The SCP Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation), with my favorites being [SCP-999](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-999),  
[SCP-001 "When Day Breaks"](https://scpfoundation.fandom.com/wiki/SCP-001_%27%27When_Day_Breaks%27%27), [SCP-4771](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4771) and [SCP-488-JP](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-488-jp).  
- [Analogue Horror](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Analog_Horror), specifically [Kane Pixel's "Backrooms"](https://kane-pixels-backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/Kane_Pixels_Backrooms_Wiki) and [Nexpo's "Liminal Land"](https://www.visitliminalland.net/).
- [Hazbin Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazbin_Hotel) and [Helluva Boss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helluva_Boss)
- [Humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans_(TV_series))
