title: "Spiritus Meus"
description: "Ah, my only primarilly Latin poem. 'Spiritus Meus,' or 'My Spirit' in English, is the result of a derealisation episode I had during the early autumn. I have no idea why I did it in primarilly Latin, it just happened. To explain the spiritual theme on this one, I am spiritual but not religious and this was a way of expressing it, I guess. I added a fully English version below, too."

Original:

```plaintext
Fluid, water…
Shapeless,
Animal, thy human.
 
Ipse ego sum,
Ego sum spiritus meus.
Homo sum,
Sum animal.
 
Homo spiritus,
Lupum figura.
 
Spiritus ignis,
Spiritus aquae,
Et, nihil sum.
 
Memento mori,
Vivere memento,
 
Fluid, water…
Shapeless,
Animal, thy human.
```

The *rough* Translation:

```plaintext
Fluid, water…
Shapeless,
Animal, thy human.

I am myself
I am my spirit.
I am a man,
I am an animal.

Spirit of Man
Shape of Wolf.

Spirit of fire
Spirit of water
And, I am nothing.
 
Remember death,
Remember to live,

Fluid, water…
Shapeless,
Animal, thy human.
```
