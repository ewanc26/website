```plaintext
i've just realised something,
that life has no meaning,
there is nothing.

there is nothing,
there is nothing,
there is no beginning or end.

we think there's a point,
drinking alcohol, smoking a joint...
but there is nothing.

there is no point,
we will just be working ourselves to death,
all of us,
all of us,
there is nothing.

all the laughter, pain, happiness...
all of it empty,
there is nothing.

there is no man in the sky,
there is no man down below,
there is nothing.

what is there,
what is there to look forward to?
there is nothing.

what do i gain by
mindlessly tapping at
this keyboard?

what do i gain by
scrolling,
looking at vapid whores,
who have no damn intellect.

it only feeds
the rich.

if there was something,
why do we suffer for them?

there is nothing,
there is nothing to look forward to.

i don't know why,
why are you still
reading this?

there is nothing.
there is nothing,
we begin and end in the dirt.
what is the point,
when there is nothing.
```
