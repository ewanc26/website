```plaintext
You would think
That todayâ€™s world
Would be more equal.

You would think
That a human, irrespective of who they are 
Would be the same in worth.

You would think wrong,
Apparently, we men are bad.
We are rapists, sexists, murderers...

We are meant
To be strong and powerful,
To be the emotionless anchor.

In society's eyes,
We are supposed to be robots
Stripped of what makes us human.

The list goes on and on, ad infinitum
The numbers keep climbing
John Doe-Dots on the suicide charts.

We are nothing.
We all cling to
Life, but we are not living.
