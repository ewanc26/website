```plaintext
Under the mind’s lock,
A clock, tick-tick-tick-tock,
Own personal lockdown.
 
Escaping reality,
Fictitious, thrilling fantasy,
Ignore the flames…
 
Day after day,
Encore et encore,
It builds up.
 
Having no
Purpose, unknown…
Howls and groans.
 
When it gets,
When it gets too much…
The fire…
The dopamine drops.
 
You’re mauled,
You’re struggling for air…
You’re burning up,
 
"Ashes to ashes…
Dust to dust..."
```
