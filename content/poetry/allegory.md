```plaintext
They don’t know
The pain I
Go through,

Skin tears,
Gums split,
Bones crack…

it’s horrible,
But I hide it.
It would scare them.

I didn’t want this,
But I was
Born a ‘monster.’

I may not
Be different
In the sense that

I haven’t got
Paralysis, or
A need for dialysis,

But I’m still
Not like the
Majority.

They yell and scream
"Wolf!" they cry, fears
Risen, so have the cages.

I don't intend
To hurt and maim
But they don't listen.
```
