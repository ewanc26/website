```plaintext
Silence,
All but the gentle
Clickity-clack of keyboards,
and phones ringing afar
 
Dark rooms,
Machines of meat,
Doing as they’re told…
 
One glitch,
And then
The axe comes…
 
Swinging straight, splattering
Smiling still, slammed head on keyboard
Crimson liquids dribble down the back
 
Pristine suits,
Drenched in
Crimson red tides,
Battery acid too
 
Machines of meat,
One axe through the CPU,
And it’s shut down for you…
 
Through the garbage chute you go,
A clone in your place,
Perfection, yes-yes…
 
This is purpose,
This is life,
This is reason.
 
Silence,
All but the gentle
Clickity-clack of keyboards,
and phones ringing afar
```
