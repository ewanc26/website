```plaintext
It’s happening…
Oh God, please
Please don’t,
Don’t let him hurt them.

I beg of you,
Jehovah, Yahweh, Jesus…

I beg of you in the
Fleeting moments,
Of my human mind,
Its final plea…

The fur, already…
Oh God…

Once he takes hold,
The Hyde to my Jekyll…
I beg of thee, oh Father,
Please don’t let
The wolf hurt them.

Panting, heaving…
Barely conscious…
Here we go, Father…

He…
He is me.
I am here…

You failed me, "Father."
That isn't much of a surprise…
The wolves always have ways
To silence, to exterminate…

We praise the Moon, it is our true master.
It brings us what You deny…
It lets us break free
Freedom, escape from our chains…
What the human was too afraid of.

You abandoned us, faux God.
You cursed Lycaon,
You cursed us...
The human doesn't understand,
We only want to be free…

All of us,
All of us,
All of us, trapped.

We can not hunt,
We can not be free,
We can not be with our own.

You cursed us, dear "Father,"
To be in the shadows
Of our humanity.
```
