# Ewan's Web Corner

Welcome to the repository for **Ewan's Web Corner**, my personal website and blog. This site is where I share my thoughts on coding, technology, and various aspects of my life.

### Site Overview

The site is built using **atproto** technology, and the structure is optimised to display posts, profile information, and various content in a user-friendly way. It's also designed to be easy to navigate, with pages like **About** and **Verification** accessible directly from the sidebar.

### Features
- **Customisable Layout:** The page layout features a left sidebar with profile info, navigation links, and pagination. The right column is dedicated to displaying posts.
- **Posts:** The site supports multiple post types, including text posts, image posts, and embedded content. Posts can be customised with rich media, such as images and embedded cards.
- **Profile Information:** The left sidebar includes a space for a profile picture, username, description, and external links.
- **Mobile Optimisation:** The site is optimised for mobile browsing, with a responsive design that adjusts to different screen sises.
