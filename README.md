# atprotoSite

This is a script that loads various atproto records onto an HTML page.

You can see it in action on our PDS [chicory.blue](https://chicory.blue/).

While a template is provided, it's intended to make it easy to write your own pages, even if you only know a little bit of HTML. It's very similar to Tumblr's legacy themes - you include whichever elements you want on your page (+post templates) and run the script. You can also use it just to add a few posts to an existing web page since it only manages the custom elements.
