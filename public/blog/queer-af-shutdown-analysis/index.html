  "articleBody": "This is a hot topic right now, huh?\nAs of right now, the queer.af Mastodon server has been seized by the Afghan Taliban. This has caused a stir among Fediverse admins, and rightfully so, as quite a few use domains on various geographic TLDs (geoTLDs).\nPros and Cons of Using Country-Specific TLDs Pros When considering the use of country-specific domain extensions like .uk or .de, several advantages come into play:\nEnhanced Visibility and Trust - Opting for a country-specific TLD can significantly boost your server’s visibility and credibility among users within that geographical region. This choice often instills a sense of trust, especially when targeting a particular community or linguistic group.\nSEO Benefits - Search engines tend to favour websites with domains that align with the user’s location. This preference can result in improved search engine rankings for your site, thereby increasing its discoverability.\nCommunity Building Opportunities - A country-specific domain can serve as a catalyst for community-building efforts, fostering a strong sense of belonging among users from the same country. This sense of unity is particularly valuable for smaller Fediverse instances seeking to cultivate a dedicated user base.\nMarketing Advantage - Utilising a geoTLD can serve as an effective marketing strategy, particularly when targeting users within a specific country. It allows for targeted messaging and outreach tailored to the cultural and linguistic nuances of that region.\nCons However, despite the benefits, there are also drawbacks to consider:\nRestricted Reach - While a country-specific TLD may strengthen your connection with users in a particular country, it inherently limits your reach to audiences outside that geographic boundary. This limitation may not align with the goals of those aiming to establish a global presence within the Fediverse.\nTechnical Complexity - Managing a geoTLD can pose technical challenges that are not typically encountered with generic domain extensions like .com or .net. This complexity may require additional expertise and resources to navigate effectively.\nPotential for Exclusion - The use of a geoTLD could be perceived as exclusionary, potentially alienating users from other countries who feel marginalised or overlooked by the platform’s focus on a specific region.\nCost Considerations - GeoTLDs often come with a higher price tag compared to generic domain extensions, adding to the overall expenses associated with maintaining your online presence. This increased cost may not be justifiable for all organisations, particularly those operating on a tight budget.\nWith that being said, what is the situation with “queer.af”?\nQueer.AF situation What’s with the domain choice? Now, I can’t say for sure, but the name could’ve been chosen as it was a LGBTQ+ friendly server, with the name being a play on that as “AF” means “as fuck” (slang term for emphasis1), while “queer” is a reclaimed term2 for the collective LGBTQ+ community.\nWhy is this “bad”? Under Taliban rule, which regained control of the country of Afghanistan in 20213, LGBTQ+ rights are not recognized, and there are significant concerns about the safety and well-being of LGBTQ+ individuals. The Taliban’s interpretation of Sharia law imposes severe penalties for same-sex relationships, ranging from imprisonment to the death penalty4.\nShutdown of the server As a result of the Taliban, the domain was seized and the server was shut down, The Verge even covered this alongside 404media.\nFallout and Aftermath Many offered refuge to those originally on queer.af, expressing pity and some even mild discontempt with the server admins.\nInternet Entropy In light of recent events surrounding the seizure of the “queer.af” domain by the Taliban, the intersection of internet entropy and geopolitical factors has come sharply into focus. This incident underscores the complexities and risks associated with online presence, particularly when operating within the increasingly entropic landscape of the internet.\nUnderstanding Internet Entropy Internet entropy, the concept of disorder and complexity within the online world, is exemplified by the proliferation of data, opinions, and digital spaces without clear organisational structures. As users contribute to this ever-expanding digital ecosystem, the lines between fact and fiction, safety and vulnerability, blur, amplifying the challenges of navigating the online realm.\nLink Rot One of the significant manifestations of internet entropy is link rot, wherein hyperlinks become broken over time as the content they reference changes or disappears. This phenomenon contributes to the disorder within the digital landscape, making it difficult for users to access reliable information and undermining the integrity of online resources.\nThis can already be seen with links on this site due to me constantly updating it, and occasionally reorganising the file structure.\nThe Impact of Domain Seizures Domain seizures, such as the case of “queer.af,” illustrate how geopolitical events can directly impact online communities and digital infrastructure. The choice of a country-specific top-level domain can enhance visibility and trust within a specific region but also exposes platforms to the jurisdictional risks associated with that country’s political climate.\nMoreover, domain seizures can exacerbate link rot by abruptly disrupting established web addresses and redirecting users to alternate destinations or dead ends. This further contributes to the entropy of the internet, complicating efforts to maintain stable and accessible online environments.\nPreventions and Precautions Use stable TLDs: Opt for established and widely recognized generic top-level domains (gTLDs) like .com, .org, or .net. These domains offer greater stability and are less susceptible to geopolitical risks compared to country-specific TLDs.\nBackup your website: Regularly back up your website’s data and content using reliable backup solutions such as Git. This ensures you have a copy in case your domain is seized or your server encounters technical difficulties. Cloud storage services and external hard drives are popular options for website backups.\nMonitor domain regulations: Stay informed about the evolving domain registration regulations and terms of service associated with your chosen domain provider and TLD. This helps you anticipate potential risks and take necessary precautions.\nConsider alternative hosting options: If you’re concerned about the stability of your current hosting provider or the jurisdiction it operates under, explore alternative hosting options in different geographical locations. This can provide redundancy and mitigate risks associated with specific governments.\nDiversify your online presence: Don’t rely solely on a single domain or platform for your online community or presence. Utilize a combination of platforms and services to spread your reach and reduce the impact of any potential disruptions.\nMy solution For my personal website, using the .UK geoTLD made sense due to my target audience and the nature of my content. However, I acknowledge the potential risks associated with country-specific TLDs and have implemented the following measures:\nRegular backups: I utilise Git for version control and maintain regular backups of my website data on cloud storage services, ensuring redundancy and quick restoration in case of issues.\nDiversified presence: While my website serves as a great online presence for myself, I also maintain a profile and engage with communities on the Fediverse, mitigating the risk of relying solely on one platform. (UPDATE: I’m now on Bluesky.)\nImpact on the Queer.AF community diaspora The seizure of the “queer.af” domain by the Taliban has had a significant impact on the LGBTQ+ community it served. Many users have been displaced, forced to find new online spaces to connect and express themselves. This has led to a diaspora of the queer.af community, with members scattering across various Fediverse instances and other platforms.\nChallenges of Displacement Finding new online communities can be challenging, especially for users who are not familiar with the Fediverse or other decentralised platforms. Language barriers and cultural differences can also pose obstacles for displaced members seeking to connect with new communities.\nI found it hard to find my footing when I first found the Fediverse. I didn’t know how to connect with anyone, no less my fellow LGBTQ+ bretheren. It was scary since X (née Twitter) had become a complete cesspool (although it already was toxic) of hate speech and homophobia, along with ableism, too. The server choices were confusing and I had no idea what I was doing.\nResilience and Community Building Despite the challenges, the queer.af community is demonstrating remarkable resilience. Many users have found new homes on other platforms and are working to rebuild their online communities. This experience has also highlighted the importance of decentralised platforms, such as the Fediverse (based on the W3C recommended decentralised social standard ActivityPub), Bluesky (based on the AT Protocol), Diaspora (based on its own self-named protocol) and others in the need for safe spaces for LGBTQ+ individuals around the world.\nConclusion In conclusion, the seizure of the “queer.af” domain by the Taliban serves as a stark reminder of the intricate interplay between internet entropy and geopolitical forces, exposing the vulnerabilities within the digital landscape and its broader implications for online communities, particularly those advocating for marginalised groups like the LGBTQ+ community. While country-specific top-level domains (TLDs) offer benefits such as enhanced visibility and community cohesion, they also subject platforms to jurisdictional risks, as evidenced by the shutdown of the queer.af Mastodon server, which underscores how geopolitical events can directly impact online communities and digital infrastructure, necessitating proactive measures to mitigate such risks.\nMoreover, the diaspora of the queer.af community demonstrates the resilience and determination of LGBTQ+ individuals to seek and establish safe spaces for expression and connection, despite adversity. This underscores the significance of decentralised platforms like the Fediverse in providing alternative, inclusive spaces for marginalised communities, highlighting the ongoing need for diverse and resilient online ecosystems in the face of geopolitical uncertainties.\nhttps://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/as-fuck ↩︎\nhttps://theconversation.com/reviled-reclaimed-and-respected-the-history-of-the-word-queer-197533 ↩︎\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive ↩︎\nhttps://www.hrw.org/report/2022/01/26/even-if-you-go-skies-well-find-you/lgbt-people-afghanistan-after-taliban-takeover ↩︎\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>This is a hot topic right now, huh?</p>
<p>As of right now, the <a href="https://queer.af">queer.af</a> <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a> server has been seized by the Afghan Taliban. This has caused a stir among <a href="https://fediverse.info">Fediverse</a> admins, and rightfully so, as quite a few use domains on various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_top-level_domain">geographic TLDs (geoTLDs)</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pros-and-cons-of-using-country-specific-tlds">Pros and Cons of Using Country-Specific TLDs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pros-and-cons-of-using-country-specific-tlds">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="pros">Pros<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pros">#</a></h3>
<p>When considering the use of country-specific domain extensions like .uk or .de, several advantages come into play:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enhanced Visibility and Trust - Opting for a country-specific TLD can significantly boost your server&rsquo;s visibility and credibility among users within that geographical region. This choice often instills a sense of trust, especially when targeting a particular community or linguistic group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SEO Benefits - Search engines tend to favour websites with domains that align with the user&rsquo;s location. This preference can result in improved search engine rankings for your site, thereby increasing its discoverability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community Building Opportunities - A country-specific domain can serve as a catalyst for community-building efforts, fostering a strong sense of belonging among users from the same country. This sense of unity is particularly valuable for smaller Fediverse instances seeking to cultivate a dedicated user base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marketing Advantage - Utilising a geoTLD can serve as an effective marketing strategy, particularly when targeting users within a specific country. It allows for targeted messaging and outreach tailored to the cultural and linguistic nuances of that region.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons">Cons<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cons">#</a></h3>
<p>However, despite the benefits, there are also drawbacks to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Restricted Reach - While a country-specific TLD may strengthen your connection with users in a particular country, it inherently limits your reach to audiences outside that geographic boundary. This limitation may not align with the goals of those aiming to establish a global presence within the Fediverse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical Complexity - Managing a geoTLD can pose technical challenges that are not typically encountered with generic domain extensions like .com or .net. This complexity may require additional expertise and resources to navigate effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potential for Exclusion - The use of a geoTLD could be perceived as exclusionary, potentially alienating users from other countries who feel marginalised or overlooked by the platform&rsquo;s focus on a specific region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost Considerations - GeoTLDs often come with a higher price tag compared to generic domain extensions, adding to the overall expenses associated with maintaining your online presence. This increased cost may not be justifiable for all organisations, particularly those operating on a tight budget.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With that being said, what is the situation with &ldquo;queer.af&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Now, I can&rsquo;t say for sure, but the name could&rsquo;ve been chosen as it was a LGBTQ+ friendly server, with the name being a play on that as &ldquo;AF&rdquo; means &ldquo;as fuck&rdquo; (slang term for emphasis<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>), while &ldquo;queer&rdquo; is a reclaimed term<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> for the collective LGBTQ+ community.</p>

<p>Under Taliban rule, which regained control of the country of Afghanistan in 2021<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, LGBTQ+ rights are not recognized, and there are significant concerns about the safety and well-being of LGBTQ+ individuals.

<h2 id="internet-entropy">Internet Entropy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#internet-entropy">#</a></h2>
<p>In light of recent events surrounding the seizure of the &ldquo;queer.af&rdquo; domain by the Taliban, the intersection of internet entropy and geopolitical factors has come sharply into focus. This incident underscores the complexities and risks associated with online presence, particularly when operating within the increasingly entropic landscape of the internet.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-internet-entropy">Understanding Internet Entropy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#understanding-internet-entropy">#</a></h3>
<p>Internet entropy, the concept of disorder and complexity within the online world, is exemplified by the proliferation of data, opinions, and digital spaces without clear organisational structures. As users contribute to this ever-expanding digital ecosystem, the lines between fact and fiction, safety and vulnerability, blur, amplifying the challenges of navigating the online realm.</p>
<h4 id="link-rot">Link Rot<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#link-rot">#</a></h4>
<p>One of the significant manifestations of internet entropy is link rot, wherein hyperlinks become broken over time as the content they reference changes or disappears. This phenomenon contributes to the disorder within the digital landscape, making it difficult for users to access reliable information and undermining the integrity of online resources.</p>
<p>This can already be seen with links on <a href="/">this site</a> due to me constantly updating it, and occasionally reorganising the file structure.</p>
<h5 id="the-impact-of-domain-seizures">The Impact of Domain Seizures<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-impact-of-domain-seizures">#</a></h5>
<p>Domain seizures, such as the case of &ldquo;queer.af,&rdquo; illustrate how geopolitical events can directly impact online communities and digital infrastructure. The choice of a country-specific top-level domain can enhance visibility and trust within a specific region but also exposes platforms to the jurisdictional risks associated with that country&rsquo;s political climate.</p>
<p>Moreover, domain seizures can exacerbate link rot by abruptly disrupting established web addresses and redirecting users to alternate destinations or dead ends. This further contributes to the entropy of the internet, complicating efforts to maintain stable and accessible online environments.</p>
<h3 id="preventions-and-precautions">Preventions and Precautions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#preventions-and-precautions">#</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use stable TLDs: Opt for established and widely recognized generic top-level domains (gTLDs) like .com, .org, or .net. These domains offer greater stability and are less susceptible to geopolitical risks compared to country-specific TLDs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backup your website: Regularly back up your website&rsquo;s data and content using reliable backup solutions such as <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. This ensures you have a copy in case your domain is seized or your server encounters technical difficulties. Cloud storage services and external hard drives are popular options for website backups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor domain regulations: Stay informed about the evolving domain registration regulations and terms of service associated with your chosen domain provider and TLD. This helps you anticipate potential risks and take necessary precautions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider alternative hosting options: If you&rsquo;re concerned about the stability of your current hosting provider or the jurisdiction it operates under, explore alternative hosting options in different geographical locations. This can provide redundancy and mitigate risks associated with specific governments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diversify your online presence: Don&rsquo;t rely solely on a single domain or platform for your online community or presence. Utilize a combination of platforms and services to spread your reach and reduce the impact of any potential disruptions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="my-solution">My solution<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#my-solution">#</a></h4>
<p>For my personal website, using the .UK geoTLD made sense due to my target audience and the nature of my content. However, I acknowledge the potential risks associated with country-specific TLDs and have implemented the following measures:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Regular backups: I utilise Git for version control and maintain regular backups of my website data on cloud storage services, ensuring redundancy and quick restoration in case of issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diversified presence: While my website serves as a great online presence for myself, I also maintain a profile and engage with communities on the Fediverse, mitigating the risk of relying solely on one platform. (<em>UPDATE: I&rsquo;m now <a href="../flying-in-the-bluesky">on Bluesky.</a></em>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="impact-on-the-queeraf-community-diaspora">Impact on the Queer.AF community diaspora<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#impact-on-the-queeraf-community-diaspora">#</a></h2>
<p>The seizure of the &ldquo;queer.af&rdquo; domain by the Taliban has had a significant impact on the LGBTQ+ community it served. Many users have been displaced, forced to find new online spaces to connect and express themselves. This has led to a diaspora of the queer.af community, with members scattering across various Fediverse instances and other platforms.</p>
<h3 id="challenges-of-displacement">Challenges of Displacement<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#challenges-of-displacement">#</a></h3>
<p>Finding new online communities can be challenging, especially for users who are not familiar with the Fediverse or other decentralised platforms. Language barriers and cultural differences can also pose obstacles for displaced members seeking to connect with new communities.</p>
<p>I found it hard to find my footing when I first found the Fediverse. I didn&rsquo;t know how to connect with anyone, no less my fellow LGBTQ+ bretheren. It was scary since X (née Twitter) had become a complete cesspool (although it <em>already was toxic</em>) of hate speech and homophobia, <em>along with ableism, too.</em> The server choices were confusing and I had no idea what I was doing.</p>
<h3 id="resilience-and-community-building">Resilience and Community Building<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#resilience-and-community-building">#</a></h3>
<p>Despite the challenges, the queer.af community is demonstrating remarkable resilience. Many users have found new homes on other platforms and are working to rebuild their online communities. This experience has also highlighted the importance of decentralised platforms, such as the Fediverse (based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">the W3C recommended  decentralised social standard ActivityPub</a>), <a href="https://bsky.social/about">Bluesky</a> (based on <a href="https://atproto.com/">the AT Protocol</a>), <a href="https://diasporafoundation.org/">Diaspora</a> (based on its own self-named protocol) and others in the need for safe spaces for LGBTQ+ individuals around the world.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>In conclusion, the seizure of the &ldquo;queer.af&rdquo; domain by the Taliban serves as a stark reminder of the intricate interplay between internet entropy and geopolitical forces, exposing the vulnerabilities within the digital landscape and its broader implications for online communities, particularly those advocating for marginalised groups like the LGBTQ+ community. While country-specific top-level domains (TLDs) offer benefits such as enhanced visibility and community cohesion, they also subject platforms to jurisdictional risks, as evidenced by the shutdown of the queer.af Mastodon server, which underscores how geopolitical events can directly impact online communities and digital infrastructure, necessitating proactive measures to mitigate such risks.</p>
<p>Moreover, the diaspora of the queer.af community demonstrates the resilience and determination of LGBTQ+ individuals to seek and establish safe spaces for expression and connection, despite adversity. This underscores the significance of decentralised platforms like the Fediverse in providing alternative, inclusive spaces for marginalised communities, highlighting the ongoing need for diverse and resilient online ecosystems in the face of geopolitical uncertainties.</p>
