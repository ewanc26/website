[{"content":"Well!\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;d be doing a follow-up to a post, but here we are. This is a two-month follow-up to \u0026ldquo;Gazing Into the Bluesky.\u0026rdquo;\nI have some new thoughts and things I wanted to update the blog on!\nThe Fediverse As you may or may not know, the Fediverse has been my social home since November 2022 after the Twitter Meltdown. No more!\nWhy is this? There are a few reasons.\nMastodon and its Toxicity Mastodon, for what it\u0026rsquo;s worth, is a great platform! I admire and love what a European company can do in the tech world! It has brilliant filtering and self-moderation tools.\nThe userbase has, sadly, slowly, gnawed me down to the point that I just\u0026hellip; can\u0026rsquo;t deal with it anymore. A lot of the time, it\u0026rsquo;s pleasant, but more and more I\u0026rsquo;ve seen toxicity drip its way into my feed.\nThose on other Fediverse platforms have actually called this part of the Mastodon community the \u0026ldquo;Mastocels\u0026rdquo; (a portmanteau of \u0026ldquo;Mastodon\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Incel\u0026rdquo;) and honestly, I can see why.\nReply Guys So, you\u0026rsquo;ve seen memes about reply guys, right?\nMastodon is rife with them. I personally feel like the perception is right in this regard. I was able to ignore this for a while, but a candle burns out.\nCommunity Curiosity General curiosity about the community is strong. I\u0026rsquo;m still finding new interesting people every day, and haven\u0026rsquo;t had a significant bad experience yet.\nFurries A lot of people don\u0026rsquo;t actually realise that the furry community is very active in the skies, as they are in the Fediverse as well. I like to mingle with them as, well, I am part of it too.\nAmazing Developer Modesty The Bluesky core developer team have been very active in the community. It\u0026rsquo;s refreshing from other tech companies, plus, Jack Dorsey has left the board so it\u0026rsquo;s not got some tech billionaire flaunting it like some shiny toy. (looking at you, Elon.)\nWrapping Up Yeah. I\u0026rsquo;m no longer really in the Fediverse. If you count BridgyFed, though, I still am!\nMy Bluesky account (@ewancroft.uk) has been bridged over to the Fediverse through BridgyFed at @ewancroft.uk@bsky.brid.gy.\n","permalink":"https://ewancroft.uk/blog/flying-in-the-bluesky/","summary":"My thoughts on Bluesky after a few months on the platform, and why I am staying.","title":"Flying In the Bluesky"},{"content":"Bluesky, bsky, whatever.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an alternative to Twitter (yes, I am still calling it Twitter, not X) and the Fediverse (such as Mastodon), running atop the AT Protocal (also known as \u0026lsquo;ATProto\u0026rsquo;).\nI decided to test it out a few days ago, with my account being @ewancroft.uk. Yes! Even domains can be used as the handles, with the default being a subdomain under bsky.social (i.e., ewancroft.bsky.social) however ATProto has a nice trick where if you add a /.well-known/ file called atproto-did and add the identifier (which you can find under Settings \u0026gt; Change Handle) on your website, you can have the domain as the handle!\nMy Thoughts Bluesky has a pretty similar feel to Twitter (in particular - early Twitter c. 2008-2013) and a similar UI. It\u0026rsquo;s not much of a surprise when co-founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, was on Bluesky\u0026rsquo;s board of directors. He initially announced Bluesky as an initiative while CEO of Twitter in 20191 and continued on with it as a board member when it was incorporated as a separate benefit corporation from Twitter in late 20211\nAnyway, enough of reading off of Wikipedia. Let me talk about what I think.\nUser Interface I quite like the UI, it\u0026rsquo;s familiar for those coming from Twitter and has the familiar layout as such. No real complaints.\nMy Annoyances It feels\u0026hellip; sort of lonely? There is an ever-present feeling of loneliness for me while I\u0026rsquo;m browsing Bluesky. Maybe I should use Graysky?\nI personally have trouble finding people on the platform, despite there being a \u0026lsquo;Discover\u0026rsquo; feed, and this gives me a disconnect. I think this is the rose-tinted glasses but I feel like Mastodon\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;Explore\u0026rsquo; page is better because it shows posts, people and hashtags. Bluesky\u0026rsquo;s equivalent feels off\u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t know why.\nLack of Markdown I know I\u0026rsquo;m spoiled for Markdown formatting, with this website\u0026rsquo;s content being written in Markdown and Mastodon Glitch Edition (a Mastodon fork) using it too, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know why even the most basic Markdown syntax is ignored, such as\n*italics*\n**bold**\n~~strikethrough~~\nwhen they are very helpful!\n300 character limit Short and sweet\u0026hellip; not.\nI\u0026rsquo;m definitely spoiled because Mastodon by default supplies 500 characters to play with per post, and infosec.exchange, my Mastodon server, supplies me with an overly generous 11000 characters.\nNo Direct Messaging Support One glaring omission in Bluesky\u0026rsquo;s feature set is the lack of direct messaging (DM) support. DMs are a crucial aspect of social media platforms, so why leave them out?\nUpdate! as of this post, DMs are here!\nLack of Post Editing Functionality Another notable absence is the inability to edit posts after they\u0026rsquo;ve been published. This lack of editing is annoying for me because I sometimes make mistakes and being able to edit them is a godsend.\nConclusion In conclusion, my initial exploration of Bluesky has revealed both promising aspects and areas for improvement. The platform\u0026rsquo;s familiar interface, and its community reminiscent of early Twitter, offer a comfortable experience for users transitioning from other social media platforms. The integration of the AT Protocol allows for unique handle customisation, showcasing Bluesky\u0026rsquo;s flexibility and potential for personalisation.\nBluesky company history (Wikipedia)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://ewancroft.uk/blog/gazing-into-the-bluesky/","summary":"My thoughts on Bluesky after a few days on the platform.","title":"Gazing Into the Bluesky"},{"content":"So, music generation is now a thing, I guess?\nI tested Suno.ai by generating a version of Lunar Descent and well, I have to say it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good.\nKinda freaky though\u0026hellip;\nThe Prompts Lyrical I created a modified version1 of Lunar Descent for the AI to work with, made sure it was good for lyrical use:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 (Verse 1, scared) It’s happening, oh God, please hear my plea, Don’t let him hurt them, don\u0026#39;t let it be.

I created my bot as I had seen other Markov chain generative bots such as @chain@brain.d.on-t.work (which is built from @kopper@brain.d.on-t.work\u0026rsquo;s posts). It sparked interest in the gibberish that it could generate, but I wanted to keep it updated, so I did it myself!\nOpen source? I also made it open-source with the MIT Licence so that other people could use my shoddy code (If it works, don\u0026rsquo;t touch it!) and build on it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m honestly just glad I was able to use Python again. It was fun to code!\nHow Does the Script work? Here is a brief explanation of how the Mastodon Markov chain bot works. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn how Markov chains work, I recommend watching this video by Harvard.\nInitialisation and Setup The script begins by importing necessary libraries like dotenv for managing environment variables, MarkovText from markovchain.text for Markov chain functionality, and Mastodon for interaction with the Mastodon API through Mastodon.py. Additionally, it imports modules for handling HTML content and regular expressions.\nEnvironment Configuration It loads environment variables from a .env file using dotenv.load_dotenv(). These variables include Mastodon base URL, access tokens, and other configuration details necessary for API authentication.\nCleaning Content A function called clean_content() is defined to sanitise HTML content fetched from Mastodon posts. It removes HTML tags, decodes HTML entities, eliminates usernames, and filters out special characters, ensuring clean input for the Markov chain.\nFetching Mastodon Posts Another function, get_account_posts(), retrieves recent posts from the specified Mastodon account. It cleans the content using the previously defined function and returns a list of sanitized posts.\nGenerating and Posting The script defines generate_and_post_example() to generate Markov chain text and post it to a destination Mastodon account. It ensures the generated text meets character limits and handles posting errors gracefully.\nDataset Refresh To keep the Markov dataset up to date, there\u0026rsquo;s a refresh_dataset() function. It fetches recent posts from the source Mastodon account, cleans them, and adds them to the Markov chain dataset.\nMain Loop The main loop orchestrates the entire process. It calculates a random refresh interval between 5 to 10 minutes and schedules the next refresh accordingly. During each iteration, it refreshes the dataset, generates and posts an example, then waits until the next refresh interval before repeating the process.\nUser Interaction The script interacts with the user when necessary, prompting for Mastodon and environment variable details if they\u0026rsquo;re not already configured. It also monitors for the ctrl+C hotkey as a way for the script to be stopped immediately.\nConclusion Working on this project reignited my love for coding in Python. The process involved in setting up the Mastodon Markov chain bot, from importing necessary libraries to cleaning content and orchestrating dataset refreshes, has been both educational and rewarding. Moreover, the interaction with users, prompt handling, and error management added a layer of complexity that enhanced the overall coding experience.\n","permalink":"https://ewancroft.uk/blog/mastodon-markov-chains/","summary":"A little blog post talking about Markov chains.","title":"Mastodon Markov Chains, and Why I Created My Own"},{"content":"Yep.\nI decided to make the jump since I wanted to branch out from solely Ubuntu-based distributions, and Fedora (Workstation) seemed like a good choice.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a part of the Red Hat lineage, so it has a different base from Ubuntu and its derivatives, which are based on Debian instead. I have looked into it around the internet and it seems to be one of the most stable distros.\nAs far as I can tell, right now, the only real difference is the use of the DNF package manager rather than APT.

I ditched Windows completely in my personal life, and as a bonus, gave life back to my laptop.\nI had refused to use it since I got my Mac mini back in August as it used Windows, but never felt comfortable enough to install a Linux distro on it due to me literally corrupting the BIOS, one time, in the process. That was until I gave System76\u0026rsquo;s Pop!_OS a chance alongside macOS, which I have been using since August of last year.\nMy Reasons to Ditch Windows It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not for everyone to jump to another operating system. It can be hard and confusing! Sometimes, change is worse than the same, but for me, that was not the case.\nI had 3 main pain points, using Windows my whole life, which was:\nClutter. The operating system just felt overly full of crap and bloatware. Who even needs TikTok on their PC?\nAdvertising. Windows is stuffed full of advertising in its most recent iterations. Just\u0026hellip; Why?\nBoredom. Windows has become quite boring to me, feeling stale and old. I needed a change.\nmacOS and my Experience with it My reasoning for going for a Mac was, quite frankly, impulsive. I had grown up with Apple devices, from an iPod Touch 4th Gen to an iPad Air 2nd Gen, so a Mac didn\u0026rsquo;t seem like a bad choice. I had since been gifted a hand-me-down iPhone 8 Plus from my mum when she upgraded her phone and bought myself an Apple Watch SE 1st Gen, so why not buy a Mac? I went for a Mac mini (M2; 256GB SSD with 16GB RAM) and I\u0026rsquo;ve been happy with it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s helped me get used to the Unix-like terminal, which is handy for Linux distributions like Pop!_OS as the Linux kernel (the core of the Linux operating system) is Unix-like and macOS\u0026rsquo;s kernel, Darwin, is Unix-based.\nSpecifications of My Mac These are the specs as described by neofetch:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 \u0026#39;c. ewan@Mac-Mini ,xNMM. ------------- .OMMMMo OS: macOS 14.3.1 23D60 arm64 OMMM0, Host: Mac14,3 .;loddo:\u0026#39; loolloddol;.

Asahi Linux is a specific project for Apple Silicon Macs, with the \u0026ldquo;flagship\u0026rdquo; distro being Fedora Asahi Remix in colaboration with The Fedora Project.\nI chose not to replace macOS on my Mac mini since I knew I might not like it, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to potentially make my £850 main PC unusable as I bought it myself as a 18th birthday present.\nPop!_OS This was a secondary choice, originally. I had installed Canonical\u0026rsquo;s Ubuntu on many a machine before, and was quite familliar with the GNOME Desktop Environmet (having used it on and off since 2020 or so), so it was a no-brainer. That was until I found a troubling history.\nI did still like the codebase, so I decided to stick with Pop!_OS, which is based on Ubuntu.\nFirst Impressions Now, I can only speak on first impressions, but it is easy for me to use. I have had some experience with Ubuntu, which Pop!_OS is based on, so the terminal commands and everything were similar. It was easy for me to swap the shells (the terminal environments) from bash to zsh being a few Google searches away, as I use zsh as my shell on macOS, so that was nice.\nIt is a little annoying that my iCloud stuff can\u0026rsquo;t be synced over, but it\u0026rsquo;s not that big of a deal since this laptop is a secondary machine.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested and have no experience, I recommend this video by Linus Tech Tips on getting started with Pop!_OS.\nSpecifications of My Laptop These are the specs as described by neofetch:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ///////////// ewan@pop-os-laptop ///////////////////// ------------------ ///////*767//////////////// OS: Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS x86_64 //////7676767676*////////////// Host: Inspiron 3501 /////76767//7676767////////////// Kernel: 6.6.10-76060610-generic /////767676///*76767/////////////// Uptime: 2 hours, 50 mins ///////767676///76767.///7676*/////// Packages: 1779 (dpkg), 1 (brew) /////////767676//76767///767676//////// Shell: zsh 5.8.1 //////////76767676767////76767///////// Resolution: 1920x1080 ///////////76767676//////7676////////// DE: GNOME 42.5 ////////////,7676,///////767/////////// WM: Mutter /////////////*7676///////76//////////// WM Theme: Pop ///////////////7676//////////////////// Theme: Pop-dark [GTK2/3] ///////////////7676///767//////////// Icons: Pop [GTK2/3] //////////////////////\u0026#39;//////////// Terminal: gnome-terminal //////.7676767676767676767,////// CPU: 11th Gen Intel i3-1115G4 (4) @ 4 /////767676767676767676767///// GPU: Intel Device 9a78 /////////////////////////// Memory: 1964MiB / 7673MiB ///////////////////// ///////////// Response One of my friends is a big proponent of Linux in general, so I know that he\u0026rsquo;ll be happy about this change.

This has caused a stir among Fediverse admins, and rightfully so, as quite a few use domains on various geographic TLDs (geoTLDs).\nPros and Cons of Using Country-Specific TLDs Pros When considering the use of country-specific domain extensions like .uk or .de, several advantages come into play:\nEnhanced Visibility and Trust - Opting for a country-specific TLD can significantly boost your server\u0026rsquo;s visibility and credibility among users within that geographical region. This choice often instills a sense of trust, especially when targeting a particular community or linguistic group.\nSEO Benefits - Search engines tend to favour websites with domains that align with the user\u0026rsquo;s location. This preference can result in improved search engine rankings for your site, thereby increasing its discoverability.\nCommunity Building Opportunities - A country-specific domain can serve as a catalyst for community-building efforts, fostering a strong sense of belonging among users from the same country. This sense of unity is particularly valuable for smaller Fediverse instances seeking to cultivate a dedicated user base.\nMarketing Advantage - Utilising a geoTLD can serve as an effective marketing strategy, particularly when targeting users within a specific country. It allows for targeted messaging and outreach tailored to the cultural and linguistic nuances of that region.\nCons However, despite the benefits, there are also drawbacks to consider:\nRestricted Reach - While a country-specific TLD may strengthen your connection with users in a particular country, it inherently limits your reach to audiences outside that geographic boundary. This limitation may not align with the goals of those aiming to establish a global presence within the Fediverse.\nTechnical Complexity - Managing a geoTLD can pose technical challenges that are not typically encountered with generic domain extensions like .com or .net. This complexity may require additional expertise and resources to navigate effectively.\nPotential for Exclusion - The use of a geoTLD could be perceived as exclusionary, potentially alienating users from other countries who feel marginalised or overlooked by the platform\u0026rsquo;s focus on a specific region.\nCost Considerations - GeoTLDs often come with a higher price tag compared to generic domain extensions, adding to the overall expenses associated with maintaining your online presence. This increased cost may not be justifiable for all organisations, particularly those operating on a tight budget.\nWith that being said, what is the situation with \u0026ldquo;queer.af\u0026rdquo;?\nQueer.AF situation What\u0026rsquo;s with the domain choice? Now, I can\u0026rsquo;t say for sure, but the name could\u0026rsquo;ve been chosen as it was a LGBTQ+ friendly server, with the name being a play on that as \u0026ldquo;AF\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;as fuck\u0026rdquo; (slang term for emphasis1), while \u0026ldquo;queer\u0026rdquo; is a reclaimed term2 for the collective LGBTQ+ community.\nWhy is this \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo;? Under Taliban rule, which regained control of the country of Afghanistan in 20213, LGBTQ+ rights are not recognized, and there are significant concerns about the safety and well-being of LGBTQ+ individuals. The Taliban\u0026rsquo;s interpretation of Sharia law imposes severe penalties for same-sex relationships, ranging from imprisonment to the death penalty4.\nShutdown of the server As a result of the Taliban, the domain was seized and the server was shut down, The Verge even covered this alongside 404media.\nFallout and Aftermath Many offered refuge to those originally on queer.af, expressing pity and some even mild discontempt with the server admins.\nInternet Entropy In light of recent events surrounding the seizure of the \u0026ldquo;queer.af\u0026rdquo; domain by the Taliban, the intersection of internet entropy and geopolitical factors has come sharply into focus. This incident underscores the complexities and risks associated with online presence, particularly when operating within the increasingly entropic landscape of the internet.\nUnderstanding Internet Entropy Internet entropy, the concept of disorder and complexity within the online world, is exemplified by the proliferation of data, opinions, and digital spaces without clear organisational structures. As users contribute to this ever-expanding digital ecosystem, the lines between fact and fiction, safety and vulnerability, blur, amplifying the challenges of navigating the online realm.\nLink Rot One of the significant manifestations of internet entropy is link rot, wherein hyperlinks become broken over time as the content they reference changes or disappears. This phenomenon contributes to the disorder within the digital landscape, making it difficult for users to access reliable information and undermining the integrity of online resources.\nThis can already be seen with links on this site due to me constantly updating it, and occasionally reorganising the file structure.\nThe Impact of Domain Seizures Domain seizures, such as the case of \u0026ldquo;queer.af,\u0026rdquo; illustrate how geopolitical events can directly impact online communities and digital infrastructure. The choice of a country-specific top-level domain can enhance visibility and trust within a specific region but also exposes platforms to the jurisdictional risks associated with that country\u0026rsquo;s political climate.\nMoreover, domain seizures can exacerbate link rot by abruptly disrupting established web addresses and redirecting users to alternate destinations or dead ends. This further contributes to the entropy of the internet, complicating efforts to maintain stable and accessible online environments.\nPreventions and Precautions Use stable TLDs: Opt for established and widely recognized generic top-level domains (gTLDs) like .com, .org, or .net. These domains offer greater stability and are less susceptible to geopolitical risks compared to country-specific TLDs.\nBackup your website: Regularly back up your website\u0026rsquo;s data and content using reliable backup solutions such as Git. This ensures you have a copy in case your domain is seized or your server encounters technical difficulties. Cloud storage services and external hard drives are popular options for website backups.\nMonitor domain regulations: Stay informed about the evolving domain registration regulations and terms of service associated with your chosen domain provider and TLD. This helps you anticipate potential risks and take necessary precautions.\nConsider alternative hosting options: If you\u0026rsquo;re concerned about the stability of your current hosting provider or the jurisdiction it operates under, explore alternative hosting options in different geographical locations. This can provide redundancy and mitigate risks associated with specific governments.\nDiversify your online presence: Don\u0026rsquo;t rely solely on a single domain or platform for your online community or presence. Utilize a combination of platforms and services to spread your reach and reduce the impact of any potential disruptions.\nMy solution For my personal website, using the .UK geoTLD made sense due to my target audience and the nature of my content. However, I acknowledge the potential risks associated with country-specific TLDs and have implemented the following measures:\nRegular backups: I utilise Git for version control and maintain regular backups of my website data on cloud storage services, ensuring redundancy and quick restoration in case of issues.\nDiversified presence: While my website serves as a great online presence for myself, I also maintain a profile and engage with communities on the Fediverse, mitigating the risk of relying solely on one platform. (UPDATE: I\u0026rsquo;m now on Bluesky.)\nImpact on the Queer.AF community diaspora The seizure of the \u0026ldquo;queer.af\u0026rdquo; domain by the Taliban has had a significant impact on the LGBTQ+ community it served. Many users have been displaced, forced to find new online spaces to connect and express themselves. This has led to a diaspora of the queer.af community, with members scattering across various Fediverse instances and other platforms.\nChallenges of Displacement Finding new online communities can be challenging, especially for users who are not familiar with the Fediverse or other decentralised platforms. Language barriers and cultural differences can also pose obstacles for displaced members seeking to connect with new communities.\nI found it hard to find my footing when I first found the Fediverse. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to connect with anyone, no less my fellow LGBTQ+ bretheren. It was scary since X (née Twitter) had become a complete cesspool (although it already was toxic) of hate speech and homophobia, along with ableism, too. The server choices were confusing and I had no idea what I was doing.\nResilience and Community Building Despite the challenges, the queer.af community is demonstrating remarkable resilience. Many users have found new homes on other platforms and are working to rebuild their online communities. This experience has also highlighted the importance of decentralised platforms, such as the Fediverse (based on the W3C recommended decentralised social standard ActivityPub), Bluesky (based on the AT Protocol), Diaspora (based on its own self-named protocol) and others in the need for safe spaces for LGBTQ+ individuals around the world.\nConclusion In conclusion, the seizure of the \u0026ldquo;queer.af\u0026rdquo; domain by the Taliban serves as a stark reminder of the intricate interplay between internet entropy and geopolitical forces, exposing the vulnerabilities within the digital landscape and its broader implications for online communities, particularly those advocating for marginalised groups like the LGBTQ+ community. While country-specific top-level domains (TLDs) offer benefits such as enhanced visibility and community cohesion, they also subject platforms to jurisdictional risks, as evidenced by the shutdown of the queer.af Mastodon server, which underscores how geopolitical events can directly impact online communities and digital infrastructure, necessitating proactive measures to mitigate such risks.\nMoreover, the diaspora of the queer.af community demonstrates the resilience and determination of LGBTQ+ individuals to seek and establish safe spaces for expression and connection, despite adversity. This underscores the significance of decentralised platforms like the Fediverse in providing alternative, inclusive spaces for marginalised communities, highlighting the ongoing need for diverse and resilient online ecosystems in the face of geopolitical uncertainties.\nhttps://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/as-fuck\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://theconversation.com/reviled-reclaimed-and-respected-the-history-of-the-word-queer-197533\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.hrw.org/report/2022/01/26/even-if-you-go-skies-well-find-you/lgbt-people-afghanistan-after-taliban-takeover\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://ewancroft.uk/blog/queer-af-shutdown-analysis/","summary":"My thoughts on the seizure of the \u0026lsquo;queer.af\u0026rsquo; domain by the Taliban, and domain seizures in general.","title":"When Your Platform Disappears: The Queer.AF Shutdown"},{"content":" 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 They don’t know The pain I Go through, Skin tears, Gums split, Bones crack… it’s horrible, But I hide it.

It\u0026rsquo;s a common thing in today\u0026rsquo;s world, with a large amount of my generation (that being Gen Z) experiencing it1. I, definitely, am not immune to it, with it affecting me severely for years. Even when I know I have friends, my enjoyment in the most niche and obscure things usually isolates me to this room, this desk even.\nI can only speak for myself when I say this, but, while my surroundings are relatively clean and tidy, my mental health is not at all ideal. I commonly think to myself that I am doing all of this for nothing, and ever since my mental health took a nosedive after the end of June last year, I have found myself leaning more and more existentially nihilistic which is not too dissimilar to others my age2.\nI even wrote multiple poems expressing this. Here is one example3:\n1 2 3 4 5 there is no point, we will just be working ourselves to death, all of us, all of us, there is nothing. Social media doesn\u0026rsquo;t help in this trend when we are being fed addicting algorithms on TikTok 4 and other platforms like it. We are having our brains hijacked. Now, I don\u0026rsquo;t use TikTok, but YouTube Shorts has the same effect. Being fed increasingly verbose and corrupting content at shorter and shorter \u0026lsquo;doses\u0026rsquo; is killing my attention span, I know that, but with the hobbies I have, it quickly gets eaten up and filled out again.\nThis, in essence, is one of the myriad of reasons why we as a generation are not able to find a pack - be it a community, a friend group or even, if we were to really lean into the analogy, a family. I used the analogy since I have a special interest on lycanthropy and wolves, but I do think it fits well nonetheless as we humans need a community, a tribe5. We, as a society, are like a wolf pack in the sense that, without one, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t survive. Just look at the time humanity almost went extinct6 and you\u0026rsquo;ll (probably) understand.\nReasons Why We Are Lonely Now, I have already touched briefly on why we are lonely as a generation, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t touched on the how, so here\u0026rsquo;s how!\nThe Rise of Smartphones (image grabbed from here)\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s an App For That\u0026rdquo;\nWe all know them, we\u0026rsquo;re all addicted to them.\nIn a world seemingly hyperconnected, paradoxically, we find ourselves increasingly isolated. The rise of smartphones, chronicled in articles such as The Atlantic\u0026rsquo;s 2017 piece7, plays a pivotal role in this intricate narrative. These sleek, handheld devices that promise connection have, in many ways, become conduits for disconnection.\nThe allure of online communities can be powerful, drawing individuals with shared interests into a virtual pack - bubbled silos of community. However, the transient nature of digital interactions often leaves us yearning for more substantial connections.\nWhile smartphones offer a window to a vast digital realm, they simultaneously act as barriers to genuine human connection. The addictive algorithms that govern platforms like TikTok and YouTube Shorts contribute to the isolation paradox. As we consume byte-sized content, our attention spans dwindle, and the very fabric of sustained meaningful connections frays. We are drifting further and further into our heads, behind a screen. It does not help that screens that strap to your face now are ubiquitous, too.\nSocial Media\u0026rsquo;s Domination Ah, so we\u0026rsquo;ve arrived at this topic. Let\u0026rsquo;s dissect it.\nSocial media provides a platform for connection, self-expression, and information-sharing, fostering a sense of community among peers. However, several negative aspects can influence mental health.\nOne notable concern is the prevalence of cyberbullying and online harassment. The constant exposure to curated, idealised versions of others\u0026rsquo; lives can lead to social comparison and feelings of inadequacy. This phenomenon is often referred to as \u0026ldquo;social media envy,\u0026rdquo; where individuals may experience anxiety and low self-esteem by comparing their lives to the seemingly perfect lives presented on social media platforms.\nMoreover, the addictive nature of social media can contribute to increased screen time, potentially leading to sleep disturbances and a sedentary lifestyle. The fear of missing out (FOMO) is another psychological impact, where individuals feel anxiety or sadness when perceiving that others are having rewarding experiences without them.\nThe Pandemic\u0026rsquo;s Chokehold Let\u0026rsquo;s not forget the coronavirus that completely shut down the world!\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had profound and far-reaching effects on individuals\u0026rsquo; lives, society, and mental health. The disruptions caused by the pandemic, such as lockdowns, social distancing measures, and economic uncertainties, have contributed to various challenges to mental well-being.\nOne significant impact is the heightened levels of stress and anxiety. The fear of contracting the virus, concerns about the health of loved ones, and the overall uncertainty about the future have been major stressors. Additionally, the isolation resulting from lockdowns has led to feelings of loneliness and depression for many individuals.\nThe pandemic has also accentuated existing social inequalities, with marginalised communities often disproportionately affected. Economic hardships, loss of employment, and educational disruptions have added to the mental health burden, particularly for those already facing socio-economic challenges.\nTime Perception Shifts I struggled a lot with this, in particular. I was 14 when COVID kicked the world down, and now I\u0026rsquo;m 18 with a lot more anxiety.\nThe pandemic has indeed had a notable impact on individuals\u0026rsquo; perception of time. For many people, the experience of time during the pandemic has been characterized by a unique blend of acceleration and deceleration.\nOn one hand, the repetitiveness of lockdowns, the monotony of daily routines, and the limited variety of activities may have led to a sense of time dragging. Days might have felt longer as people faced challenges in finding new and engaging ways to spend their time.\nOn the other hand, the rapid changes and uncertainties brought about by the pandemic could have created a feeling of time slipping away. The constant adjustments to new information, evolving guidelines, and the overall unpredictability of the situation might have made it difficult for individuals to establish a stable and consistent sense of time.\nMoreover, the blurring of boundaries between work and personal life due to remote work and changes in daily schedules may have contributed to a distorted perception of time. The lack of distinct transitions between different environments, such as commuting to the office, can impact the brain\u0026rsquo;s internal clock and make time seem less defined.\nA Personal Analysis I have, as I said, struggled a lot with the complete loss of time perception. In 2023 and now leading into 2024, I have been tracking my media consumption habits (in particular, supernatural fiction) and here is what I have realised:\nTitle Times Viewed/Listened Teen Wolf (1985 original) 1 Wolf Pack 1 The Company of Wolves 1 Scream Street (CBBC) 1 An American Werewolf in Paris 1 An American Werewolf in London BBC Audio Drama 4 An American Werewolf in London 2 The Order (Netflix) 2 The Imperfects (Netflix) 2 Wednesday (Netflix) 2 Wolfwalkers (Apple TV+) 2 Teen Wolf - The Movie (MTV) 3 Teen Wolf (MTV) 3 Wolfblood (CBBC) 4 When I do the maths on the amount of time, it comes out to be over a month. I was shocked when I found this out, as this is not something I anticipated at all.\nWhat Can We Do? In the face of the challenges posed by the modern world, especially for us teens and young adults grappling with loneliness and its various causes, it becomes crucial to explore avenues for improvement. Addressing this issue requires a multi-faceted approach that encompasses both individual actions and societal changes.\nAppreciate In-Person Connection One strategy involves a conscious effort to foster in-person connections. While digital platforms offer a semblance of connection, they often fall short in providing the depth and authenticity needed for meaningful relationships. Encouraging activities that bring people together physically, such as community events, clubs, or even casual gatherings, can help break the barriers of virtual communication.\nPromote Healthy Digital Well-being Given the undeniable role of smartphones and social media in contributing to feelings of isolation, promoting digital well-being becomes imperative. This involves being mindful of one\u0026rsquo;s screen time, actively managing app usage, and seeking a healthy balance between online and offline activities. Embracing activities that nurture mental well-being, like reading, outdoor pursuits, or hobbies, can help counter the negative effects of excessive screen time.\nCultivate Supportive Online Communities While acknowledging the pitfalls of certain online platforms, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to recognize the positive potential of the digital realm. Actively seeking out and participating in online communities that align with one\u0026rsquo;s interests can provide a sense of belonging. Platforms that facilitate constructive discussions and shared experiences can serve as virtual packs, fostering connections that transcend the limitations of physical boundaries.\nPrioritise Mental Health Education To address the root causes of loneliness, prioritising mental health education is paramount. Understanding the impact of factors like smartphone usage, social media dynamics, and external stressors is crucial for individuals navigating the complexities of the modern world. Educational initiatives, both formal and informal, can empower individuals to make informed choices and build resilience against the challenges to mental well-being.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re Not Alone Helplines There are multiple online helplines and resources if you are struggling, I have correlated some international ones.\nUnited Kingdom Mind: Offers information and support for mental health, with a website full of resources and a helpline open Monday-Friday from 09:00-18:00. Rethink Mental Illness: Provides information and support for people affected by mental illness, including their families and friends. They also offer advocacy and campaigning work. The Mix: Provides support for young people aged 16-25, offering confidential information and advice on everything from mental health to relationships and housing. United States The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI): The largest mental health organisation in the US, offering support, education, and advocacy for individuals and families affected by mental illness. The Jed Foundation: Works to protect emotional health and prevent suicide among teens and young adults. They offer resources and programs for students, parents, and educators. The Trevor Project: Provides crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to LGBTQ+ youth. They offer a 24/7 helpline, online chat, and texting service. Others There is also the International Association for Suicide Prevention(IASP) directory of helplines, and the World Health Organisation\u0026rsquo;s Mental Health team.\nSelf-Care While online options are great, you may want to take a walk in the park or go to a local community centre in your town or city. Remember, in-person is better than online.\nIf you are able, you may also want to spend time with your family, as, in my experience, just being with family can help immensely. Have a chat with them, it can help with processing your emotions.\nI am sorry for not providing any other country besides the UK and US, but I hope these resources are good enough for you, reader.\nConclusion In conclusion, the quest for connection and the struggle against loneliness among the Gen Z cohort is a complex narrative shaped by various societal and technological factors. Loneliness, as experienced and expressed by individuals like myself, is not merely a personal woe but a shared struggle that echoes across our generation.\nThe emergence of smartphones, touted as instruments of connection, paradoxically contributes to isolation. The addictive nature of digital platforms, exemplified by the alluring yet insidious algorithms of TikTok and YouTube Shorts, pulls us into a realm where connection becomes fleeting and substance is sacrificed for brevity.\nSimultaneously, the dominance of social media, while offering a virtual platform for connection, introduces its own set of challenges. The curated perfection showcased on these platforms fuels social comparison, leading to feelings of inadequacy and loneliness. The addictive loops and the fear of missing out (FOMO) further exacerbate the isolation paradox, highlighting the dark side of the digital age.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, acting as a seismic disruptor, casts a long shadow on our collective mental well-being. The upheavals it brings - from lockdowns to economic uncertainties - intensify feelings of stress, anxiety, and, above all, loneliness. The distortion of time perception, a shared experience among many of us, underscores the unique challenges posed by the pandemic era.\nHowever, amidst the challenges, avenues for improvement emerge. A conscious effort to appreciate in-person connections, promote healthy digital well-being, cultivate supportive online communities, and prioritize mental health education can collectively pave the way forward. The significance of these measures lies not just in alleviating individual loneliness but in fostering a societal shift towards genuine connection.\nIn essence, the conclusion to the exploration of loneliness in the context of Gen Z is a call for collective reflection and action. The quest for a pack, a community, or a tribe is not insurmountable, and the narrative of loneliness can be rewritten through shared efforts and a commitment to authentic connection.\nhttps://www.deseret.com/2023/11/15/23958265/report-gen-z-teenagers-lonelier-more-apt-therapy-less-likely-use-drugs, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA_m4JVxX1Q\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://thred.com/culture/offbeat/understanding-gen-zs-expected-uptake-in-nihilism/, https://gnet-research.org/2022/12/16/generation-doomer-how-nihilism-on-social-media-is-creating-a-new-generation-of-extremists/, https://www.yourtango.com/entertainment/spiritual-director-explains-why-worried-about-gen-zs-nihilism\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nA stanza from my poem \u0026rsquo;nothing\u0026rsquo; (© Ewan Croft under CC BY-ND-NC 4.0.)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/tech/tiktok-addiction-symptoms-study-users-b2072116.html, https://www.deseret.com/2022/5/6/23055481/tik-tok-addiction-social-media-mental-health-psychology\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-squeaky-wheel/202002/the-importance-belonging-tribe, https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/13/t-magazine/tribe-meaning.html\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.history.com/news/prehistoric-ancestors-population-decline\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://ewancroft.uk/blog/finding-a-pack-gen-z-analysis/","summary":"A look into why Generation Z are the most isolated and lonely.","title":"Finding A Pack: Why Is It So Hard for Us as Gen Z?"},{"content":"Most people really don\u0026rsquo;t realise the actual logistics of a lycanthropic curse, in the modern age, do they?\nIt is literally in the name, a curse, but modern fiction, particularly post-millennium, has romanticised it1 to the point that the original horror has been quite often lost. I\u0026rsquo;m not, by any means, saying that any of the works of fiction are particularly wrong, per se, as it is just that, speculatory fiction, but it did start as something unwanted.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at how things have shifted, pun intended.\nHistorical Depictions The Myth of Lycaon As most might expect if they, like myself, have looked at basically any lycanthropic fiction pieces, the Arcadian King Lycaon is sure to pop up in mention or reference.\nI should know, I did a poem with a stanza2 referencing him, and by proxy, referring to Zeus:\n1 2 3 4 5 You abandoned us, faux God. You cursed Lycaon, You cursed us... The human doesn\u0026#39;t understand, We only want to be free... The myth of Lycaon is among the oldest in Western writings3 to depict werewolves as we would, somewhat, recognise them today.\n(image from here)\nThe myth is widely accepted to be one of the origins of modern-day depictions of lycanthropy and as such, is pretty famous.\nThe Lycaon myth weaves a profound influence on contemporary portrayals of werewolves, leaving an indelible mark that extends beyond the mere concept of human-to-wolf transformation. Its resonance is felt in various facets, shaping the narratives of lycanthropy in modern fiction.\nFirstly, the Curse Motif stands as a prominent pillar. Lycaon\u0026rsquo;s metamorphosis into a beast acts as a cautionary tale, underscoring the repercussions of violating divine laws. This narrative framework lays the foundation for the tragic stories of cursed individuals grappling with their monstrous nature in present-day fiction, evident in characters like Scott Howard from \u0026ldquo;Teen Wolf\u0026rdquo; or the conflicted protagonist, David Kessler, in \u0026ldquo;An American Werewolf in London.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Savage Within, another thematic thread, taps into a primal fear dwelling within humanity—the untamed wilderness lurking in the shadows. Lycaon\u0026rsquo;s descent into savagery mirrors the potential for individuals to succumb to their baser instincts. This primal theme resonates in contemporary stories such as The Twilight Saga, where werewolves embody both primal urges and a profound connection to the natural world.\nFurthermore, the myth raises questions about Morality and Transformation. Does Lycaon\u0026rsquo;s transformation serve as a punishment for wickedness, or does it unveil a pre-existing darkness within him? This ambiguity fuels modern narratives that delve into the intricate relationship between identity, morality, and the inner beast, as witnessed in shows like True Blood and Hemlock Grove.\nThe Price of Hospitality adds a layer of cautionary morality to the werewolf myth. Zeus\u0026rsquo; wrath is triggered by Lycaon\u0026rsquo;s violation of guest-host rights, emphasizing the sacred tenet in Greek culture. This element injects a cautionary note into the werewolf narrative, suggesting that transgressing social norms and abusing hospitality can have dire consequences. This theme finds echoes in contemporary stories where werewolves often serve as protectors of community and upholders of tradition.\nFinally, beyond monstrosity, the Lycaon myth hints at nuance. While Lycaon faces Zeus\u0026rsquo; wrath, his sons are spared, implying that transformation isn\u0026rsquo;t inherently evil. This opens the door for modern interpretations that paint the werewolf as a complex figure capable of both good and evil, exemplified in characters like Remus Lupin from the Harry Potter series. The myth, like a spectral thread, weaves through the fabric of contemporary lycanthropic tales, leaving an enduring imprint on our understanding of this mythical creature.\nAll this considered, the Greek legend is not, by any means, the sole influence of the modern depiction of the ability.\nThe Ossory Werewolves Much of the mysticism of these wolfmen is down to various stories, such as the Werewolves of Ossory, originating as early as 1200 C.E.\n(image from here)\nThe Ossory Werewolves are legendary shapeshifters from Irish folklore, specifically associated with the ancient kingdom of Ossory in the southeast of the country. Their origins have two main strands:\nAccording to this first legend, the werewolves descended from a mythical warrior named Laignech Fáelad4, whose line later gave rise to the kings of Ossory. This suggests a hereditary curse or inherent magical ability within the bloodline.\nAnother strand attributes the transformation to a divine curse placed upon the people of Ossory for their wickedness and defiance, particularly against Saint Patrick during his Christianisation of Ireland5. This framing paints the werewolves as monstrous and deserving of their fate.\nThe Ossory Werewolves have left their mark on modern portrayals of these creatures in several ways:\nThe concept of a cyclical transformation, often tied to specific nights or periods, like the seven-year curse4 in some Ossory tales, is echoed in modern werewolf lore.\nUnlike the clear-cut good vs evil narratives of some werewolf stories, the Ossory legends present a more nuanced picture. Some werewolves are cursed and monstrous, while others are simply fulfilling a preordained role or even seeking help. This moral ambiguity adds depth and complexity to modern werewolf characters.\nThe association with the wild and untamed nature of wolves, a key element of the Ossory myth, remains a defining characteristic of werewolves in popular culture\nModern Depictions 20th Century 1941\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;The Wolf Man\u0026rsquo; (image from here)\nThe Wolf Man stands as a pivotal work in the realm of horror cinema, casting an enduring shadow over the portrayal of werewolves in popular culture. Its profound influence has left an indelible mark, shaped the very essence of the werewolf mythos and served as a wellspring of inspiration for contemporary filmmakers and writers.\nKey facets of The Wolf Man\u0026rsquo;s impact on modern lycanthropic depictions include:\nThe film\u0026rsquo;s depiction of the werewolf, characterized by an elongated snout, pointed ears, and shaggy fur, has evolved into the archetype of the modern werewolf. Lon Chaney Jr.\u0026rsquo;s transformative performance, marked by agonizing contortions, remains a benchmark in cinematic history. It also could be coincidental that it looks similar to hypertrichosis.\nThe Wolf Man presents a departure from the mindless monster trope, portraying the titular character as a tragic hero ensnared by his own curse. This nuanced archetype, torn between human and animal instincts, has reverberated in werewolf narratives from An American Werewolf in London (1981) to Twilight (2005; book, 2008; film).\nThe film established the full moon as the catalyst for werewolf transformations, a trope ingrained in popular culture despite lacking roots in folklore.\nThe Wolf Man\u0026rsquo;s demise via a silver bullet has become synonymous with werewolves, although its prevalence in modern stories has waned.\nExploring identity, duality, and the struggle between good and evil, The Wolf Man paved the way for werewolf stories delving into complex human issues.\nBeyond these specific tropes, the film\u0026rsquo;s overarching tone and atmosphere have left an enduring imprint on the werewolf genre. Its dark, gothic visuals, adept use of suspense and melodrama, and exploration of the darker facets of human nature collectively contribute to the enduring portrayal of werewolves in modern media.\nWhile acknowledging The Wolf Man\u0026rsquo;s seminal influence, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to recognise that it\u0026rsquo;s not the sole contributor to shaping contemporary lycanthropic depictions. Other films have also played pivotal roles, weaving a rich tapestry that continues to evolve in the ever-expanding werewolf genre.\n1981\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;An American Werewolf in London\u0026rsquo; You can read my real-time review of the BBC Radio 1 adaptation on my blog\n(image from here)\nAn American Werewolf in London, a monumental force in shaping modern werewolf portrayals, distinctively complements the legacy of The Wolf Man, 40 years after and following its tail, leaving an indelible mark on the genre. Here\u0026rsquo;s how it etched its influence:\nJohn Landis\u0026rsquo; film spearheaded a revolution in practical effects, notably in Rick Baker\u0026rsquo;s ground-breaking werewolf transformation sequence. This visceral metamorphosis, utilizing prosthetics and stop-motion animation, achieved an unprecedented level of realism and horror, redefining cinematic transformations.\nAn American Werewolf in London adeptly intertwines horror with dark humour, infusing the narrative with wit and satire. Landis leverages this blend to explore themes of alienation, cultural clashes, and the absurdities of bureaucratic red tape, elevating the werewolf mythos with depth and memorability.\nDelving into the character\u0026rsquo;s psyche beyond previous werewolf stories, the film explores David\u0026rsquo;s struggles with accepting his monstrous nature, the guilt over transformations, and the fear of losing his humanity. This added layer of psychological complexity resonates profoundly with audiences.\nUnlike traditional monster-hunting narratives, An American Werewolf in London doesn\u0026rsquo;t cast the werewolf against a human hero. Instead, the film focuses on David\u0026rsquo;s journey of understanding and coping with his condition, subverting expectations and infusing the werewolf trope with a tragic dimension.\nThe film\u0026rsquo;s impact reverberates in numerous werewolf movies that followed, with Teen Wolf (1985) incorporating humour and coming-of-age themes and Dog Soldiers (2002) embracing the action-horror blend. Its influence extends beyond the horror genre, with films like Ginger Snaps (2000) exploring themes of female identity and sexuality through the werewolf lens.\nAn American Werewolf in London\u0026rsquo;s enduring legacy lies in its innovative special effects, genre-defying blend, and exploration of the human condition within the werewolf myth. Challenging traditional tropes, paved the way for future interpretations, securing its status as a horror comedy classic that continues to inspire filmmakers and captivate audiences.\nPost-Millennium Twilight (book and film series; 2005-2020) Diverging significantly in tone and style from the classic horror of The Wolf Man and the visceral realism of An American Werewolf in London, the Twilight saga has undeniably etched its imprint on the modern werewolf portrayal, despite its primary focus on vampirism.1\nIn Twilight, the werewolf myth underwent a profound transformation, infused with a generous dose of teen romance. This narrative shift aimed to broaden the genre\u0026rsquo;s appeal, particularly among young adults. The forbidden love story between Bella Swan and Edward Cullen, a \u0026ldquo;vegetarian\u0026rdquo; vampire, redirected attention from monstrous transformations and gory violence to emotional turmoil, internal conflicts, and the intricate complexities of navigating love and desire.\nDeparting from the ferocious beasts of traditional lore, Twilight\u0026rsquo;s werewolves, led by the brooding Jacob Black, emerged as ripped, tattooed heartthrobs. Possessing a strong sense of loyalty and family, their transformations, while still potent, took on a sleek and controlled aesthetic. Glowing eyes and enhanced physical prowess accompanied these metamorphoses, catering to a new generation drawn to the allure of a \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; monster.\nTwilight introduced a sophisticated social structure within the werewolf pack, featuring an alpha leader and stringent behavioural rules. This injected a layer of intrigue and conflict into the narrative, as characters like Jacob grappled with their positions within the pack and the challenges of upholding their responsibilities.\nThe Twilight series blurred the boundaries between humans and monsters, portraying werewolves not merely as fearsome creatures but as individuals with their desires, vulnerabilities, and moral compasses. This departure from traditional monster narratives provided a nuanced perspective on the werewolf archetype.\nThe physical transformations in Twilight served as a metaphor for the emotional and social changes teenagers undergo during puberty. Jacob\u0026rsquo;s struggle to control his wolf side mirrored the challenges of navigating identity, fitting in, and finding one\u0026rsquo;s place in the world. This resonated with young readers who saw their own struggles mirrored in the characters\u0026rsquo; journeys.\nWhile Twilight\u0026rsquo;s influence on the werewolf genre is undeniable, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to acknowledge that its unique brand of lycanthropy faced criticism for romanticising potentially dangerous creatures and portraying unhealthy relationships. Nevertheless, it significantly broadened the genre\u0026rsquo;s appeal, paving the way for more diverse and nuanced werewolf stories that explore themes beyond traditional monster hunting and teenage angst.\nWolf Pack (Book; 2004, TV series; 2023) Wolf Pack, a 2004 book by Edo van Belkom adapted by Jeff Davis (of MTV Teen Wolf fame) into the 2023 TV series, has two distinct versions.\nJeff Davis\u0026rsquo; adaptation takes a refreshing departure from conventional lycanthropic tropes, offering a nuanced and distinctive perspective on the transformative nature of lycanthropy. Here\u0026rsquo;s an exploration of its portrayal:\nFound Family Dynamic: \u0026ldquo;Wolf Pack\u0026rdquo; places significant emphasis on the concept of the pack, presenting it not merely as a biological unit but as a chosen family. Bitten teenagers, Everett and Blake, along with Luna, a born werewolf, form a powerful bond that transcends their individual transformations, highlighting the importance of finding family in their lives.\nShared Challenges, Individual Struggles: While the characters collectively grapple with the challenges posed by lycanthropy, the show intricately portrays their experiences as deeply personal. Everett\u0026rsquo;s battle with anxiety and self-doubt and Blake\u0026rsquo;s confrontation with anger and rebellion showcase the individual struggles within the broader context of their shared condition. Luna, embodying her inherent wolf nature, acts as a bridge between these two worlds.\nLycanthropy as a Metaphor: Going beyond the physical transformation, \u0026ldquo;Wolf Pack\u0026rdquo; delves into the psychological and emotional impact of lycanthropy. The characters confront issues of identity, control, and belonging, providing viewers with a poignant exploration of navigating a world that feels increasingly unfamiliar.\nNuanced Morality - Shades of Gray: In contrast to conventional portrayals of werewolves as inherently monstrous, \u0026ldquo;Wolf Pack\u0026rdquo; introduces a more complex perspective. The characters navigate a moral landscape coloured by fear, loyalty, and self-preservation, blurring the lines between good and evil and challenging traditional dichotomies.\nGender Fluidity in Werewolf Lore: The show breaks away from the conventional male-centric werewolf narrative by placing Luna, a strong and independent female character, at the forefront. This choice challenges established gender stereotypes within the werewolf lore, adding a refreshing and progressive dimension to the narrative.\nExploration of Trauma and Resilience: \u0026ldquo;Wolf Pack\u0026rdquo; delves into the intricate link between trauma and lycanthropy. The characters\u0026rsquo; transformations are often triggered by past events, underscoring the show\u0026rsquo;s commitment to emotional depth and character development.\nEdo van Belkom\u0026rsquo;s original novel serves as the bedrock for Jeff Davis\u0026rsquo;s adaptation. While sharing core themes of pack dynamics and personal struggles, the book offers a bleaker and more suspenseful portrayal of lycanthropy.\nRaw and Swift Transformations: In contrast to the gradual shifts in the TV adaptation, the book\u0026rsquo;s transformations are swift and agonizing. The characters are overtaken by animalistic urges, losing control over their senses and actions. This raw portrayal underscores the primal force unleashed by the curse.\nPredatory Nature and Instinct: The novel places a greater emphasis on the predatory instincts of the wolves. Hunting becomes an irresistible urge, blurring the lines between humans and animals and adding a layer of danger and unpredictability to the characters\u0026rsquo; struggles.\nLiving in Shadows - Paranoia and Isolation: Characters in the book exist in a perpetual state of paranoia and isolation, fearing exposure and persecution. This constant need for secrecy forces them to live double lives, adding psychological torment to their transformative experiences.\nQuestioning Humanity - Ethical Implications: The novel grapples with the ethical implications of lycanthropy, as characters confront their capacity for violence and question their place in the human world. This moral ambiguity adds depth and complexity to their journey.\nStrength in Unity Amidst Bleakness: Despite the grimness, the book offers a glimmer of hope through the power of the pack. Characters find solace and support in each other, forging a bond that transcends their individual struggles, echoing the theme of a found family present in both the book and the TV show.\nConclusion In conclusion, the journey through the rich tapestry of lycanthropy, from its ancient roots in myths like that of Lycaon to the nuanced and diverse portrayals in modern fiction, reveals a captivating evolution of the werewolf archetype. The exploration of historical depictions, such as the Ossory Werewolves, showcases the multifaceted nature of these mythical creatures, adding layers of complexity that continue to influence contemporary narratives.\nThe 20th-century cinematic contributions, notably \u0026lsquo;The Wolf Man\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;An American Werewolf in London,\u0026rsquo; have left an indelible mark on the genre, shaping the visual and emotional language of werewolf tales. The post-millennium shift, exemplified by the \u0026lsquo;Twilight\u0026rsquo; series and \u0026lsquo;Wolf Pack,\u0026rsquo; reflects the genre\u0026rsquo;s adaptability to changing cultural sensibilities, embracing themes beyond traditional horror and delving into the emotional and relational aspects of lycanthropy.\nAs we navigate through the landscapes of ancient myths, cinematic masterpieces, and modern novels, it becomes evident that the werewolf, once a symbol of terror and curse, has transformed into a complex and multifaceted character. The enduring resonance of these narratives lies not only in their ability to evoke fear but also in their capacity to explore profound themes of identity, morality, and the eternal struggle between humanity and the primal within.\nUltimately, the logistics of lycanthropy may remain a speculative mystery, but the enduring allure of werewolf tales lies in their power to mirror and navigate the complexities of the human condition. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s the ancient howls echoing through mythic forests or the modern-day struggles depicted on screen and in literature, the werewolf continues to captivate our imaginations, reminding us that within the realms of transformation, there exists a profound exploration of what it means to be human.\nTwilight (series)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nA stanza from my poem \u0026lsquo;Lunar Descent\u0026rsquo; (© Ewan Croft under CC BY-ND-NC 4.0.)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n\u0026lsquo;According to Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Book I.

I didn\u0026rsquo;t know it yet, but the loops and random interval ball-bouncing simulations taught me the very basics of programming and gamified it. The MIT knew what they were doing and really executed (heh) it well.\n2019 Jumping ahead a few years, I had ICT lessons in secondary school. We were using some kind of Visual Basic (.NET) to create some very rudimentary applications. I ended up creating a Doctor Who(?) quiz game, but I really soured on the whole idea of programming. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why, I think I got sick of it by proxy due to mental health issues at the time.\nMay 2022 I have a definitive month for this one! In May 2022 I decided, out of boredom, to start (rather, try) learning Python. I used an hour-long tutorial on YouTube to get started and built up my knowledge over time by doing a mix of tutorial projects (like an age calculator, an actual calculator, and other things) and my own stuff, such as the Mastodon bot I did which has since been improved and moved around. It generates a pixelated image, similar to TV static, based on a random string of characters and assigned colour values, before posting it to Mastodon (a Twitter-like social media which is decentralised. Basically means that anyone can host a Mastodon server) with the input string as the post text.\n2023 and 2024 May 2023 In May 2023, I decided to create a proper website. I had been using Linktree and later (briefly) Carrd, but I was sick of the restrictions. I looked around, particularly on the Fediverse, and found out about Neocities, which is a reboot of (Yahoo) GeoCities.\nDue to its Web 1.0 style of doing things, I was tasked with learning the main three basic programming languages for Web Development; HTML, CSS and JavaScript/JS. I managed to get a working site up and running in about 3 hours of hyperfocus.\nThis set-up was fine, for about three months.\nI moved my code over to GitHub and started hosting it with Github Pages. I continued to learn HTML, CSS and JS as I went about with the website.\n↓ The final version before this current one you see now looked like this! ↓\n↓ Compared to the current look! ↓\nI can revert to the previous version, but it would kill off my blog. 😓\nAugust 2023 Switching from Windows to macOS in August was a bigger deal than it might seem. Windows machines and Macs run on different systems, like Windows with its own NT kernel and Macs with the Darwin kernel (which powers other Apple devices too). So, I had to learn a whole new set of commands and ways of working. It was like switching spoken languages, such as English to Spanish.\nAnyway, with the shift from Windows to macOS, it took me a while to get back in the swing of things. I took my time to adjust to the new environment and I\u0026rsquo;ve managed, now I\u0026rsquo;m more comfortable with the Mac than Windows.\nJanuary 2024 and Thereafter It all leads up to now, with me now using Hugo to manage my website which I bought a domain (do you see it in your address bar?) for.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure where I\u0026rsquo;ll go from here between programming and my other endeavours such as my poetry, but I think I will continue with how I am for now, before I do anything too serious in the future.\nI do think that this is a good choice for a hobby, or even a job if you\u0026rsquo;d prefer. Take a look at the guide on Python that I used if you want to get started with Python. It gives people a good springboard as it covers the basics and isn\u0026rsquo;t too long at just an hour in length.\nThanks for reading! 👋🏻\n","permalink":"https://ewancroft.uk/blog/my-journey-in-programming/","summary":"I thought about doing this for a while, so here, my programming journey as I remember it.","title":"My Journey in Programming"},{"content":"HEY!\nYou might\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that I have revamped this site.\nYep, I have.

This is a real-time review, so I discuss a lot of the details!\nSo, as most horror fans would know, the 1981 comedy-horror \u0026lsquo;An American Werewolf in London\u0026rsquo; was a renowned success and is referenced a lot in subsequent lycanthropic fiction; I would say, \u0026lsquo;An American Werewolf in London\u0026rsquo; is a brilliant watch, and, despite its dated references to erotic cinemas and the wedding of at-the-time Prince Charles and Lady Diana, is timeless.\nHowever, most would forget about the BBC\u0026rsquo;s 1997 made-for-radio audio adaptation of the film. Not much fanfare for it, sadly, but here are my ramblings as I listen through it for the first time. The following thoughts are typed out as the story progresses, so forgive any missed cues and such.\nI like the opening giving some precedence to the werewolf who kills Jack and turns David on the moors. He is shown to be a crazed man, presumably locked up in a mental facility, and breaks out upon turning under the moon\u0026rsquo;s glow. The scene clearly expresses the chaotic nature of the full moon reaching its zenith, with the suspense rising as the moon waxes and then waning after the escape.\nDuring the later scene when our protagonist and deuteragonist get attacked by the werewolf, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot more drawn out and visceral than its film counterpart. I love the detail of the pair not being able to discern what it was while it circled them.\nJack later shows up at the hospital in a hallucination of David\u0026rsquo;s, and (unlike in the film, this was a deleted scene) eats a piece of toast that falls out of his left cheek, illustrating that his left bust and face were now ripped up viscera.\nWhile in limbo, Jack meets a new character, along with the presumably hundreds of other werewolf victims going back centuries. I like the detail of the character, who we come to know as Larry, admitting that he was a victim in his own right as the curse\u0026rsquo;s carrier, with Jack then calling him a \u0026lsquo;son of a bitch\u0026rsquo; for killing him.\nI do quite like that the relationships between David and Jack and David and Alex are expanded. The sex scene in the shower between the latter pair was a nice change, with Jack watching on in jealousy (while feeling perverse and talking with Larry, who we had learnt to be the werewolf that caused all of this in the first place, while in limbo. Larry had been killed by his brother, George.)\nI love the sound design of it overall as I\u0026rsquo;ve said, the music building to a crescendo during tension is brilliant, the storming and breathing on the moors and around The Slaughtered Lamb, the steamy music of the sex scenes, all of it is brilliant. You can easily tell when a new scene starts and ends with the corresponding sound design, it\u0026rsquo;s excellent.\nDuring the first transformative scene for David, we would see children laughing at him as he gets locked out of Alex\u0026rsquo;s flat near the start; in the audio adaptation, a child asks him to grab them their dog that had wandered across the fence of Alex\u0026rsquo;s flat, to which David obliged and went to grab the animal, only to be met with snarling and barking despite the child later claiming that the dog was usually very friendly with strangers. This is a nice detail as there is a superstition that animals can sense the supernatural. Later in the scene, there\u0026rsquo;s a cat that hisses at David, emphasising this point nicely.\nJack and David are both revealed to be Jews, something not touched on in the film (with the only reference being a throwaway gag in the recovery scene between nurses Price and Gallagher; \u0026lsquo;I think he\u0026rsquo;s a Jew.\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;What makes you say that?\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve had a look.\u0026rsquo;) but expanded on in the audio adaptation as there are two quotes; \u0026lsquo;Yeah, well the rabbi didn\u0026rsquo;t cover being undead\u0026rsquo; from Jack to Larry upon response to the idea of limbo, and \u0026lsquo;One packet of bacon? Note, I am not tempted by the bacon. Is this because I am not a werewolf or because I am a Jewish werewolf?\u0026rsquo; from David during his ramblings to himself while exploring Alex\u0026rsquo;s fridge in the first transformation scene before the shift. I like this expansion of their characters as it fleshes them out more compared to the film\u0026rsquo;s portrayals.\nOnce again, the fantastic sound design illustrates something\u0026rsquo;s coming. It\u0026rsquo;s very foreboding, tempered by David\u0026rsquo;s naivety to the situation at first. The scene is intercut by another, but David seems irritated that he hasn\u0026rsquo;t become a werewolf despite the moonrise, suggesting a want of satisfaction for David to prove to himself he\u0026rsquo;s not crazy. I quite like this change from the film\u0026rsquo;s depiction, which was straightforward, raw and quick in comparison.\nWhen we come back to the scene, David is seen to be trying to distract himself, rationalising that he isn\u0026rsquo;t a werewolf and just needs \u0026lsquo;a good meal and eight hours of solid sleep.\u0026rsquo; He eventually finds a book and starts reading when the transformation starts, aligning with the film. In the film, David cries out before collapsing on the floor as if he has a migraine; in the radio adaptation, he seems to be struck by a lorry because of how sudden it is, which is a nice detail of what a migraine could feel like. I love the sound design as while David pleads out during the transformation, his voice distorts to inhuman lows and eventually into animalistic, lupine cries, David is crying out for Jack and forgiveness. This is a nice touch, as it illustrates the pair\u0026rsquo;s deep friendship as best friends and suggests that David feels that the transformation is revenge for Jack being killed. This builds character for David, showcasing that he is remorseful, and prompts the listener to feel sorry for him.\nThe subsequent murder spree was relatively unchanged, with the couple and doctor, homeless people, and businessman all being killed in manners like the portrayal in the film. The sound design is quite visceral and gruesome, but perfectly illustrates the scene of the werewolf attacks in the listener. I love the extra mile it goes for the same effect as the film. The voicemail message at Alex\u0026rsquo;s flat is also endearing, with Alex starting it as normal until David interrupts with a joking howl.\nThe following scene, preceded by another one with Dr Hirsch, is expanded, opening with the sound of David snoring while a child pesters his mother about where the wolf pen is, illustrating that David is in a zoo. Of course, this is necessary for an audio drama, and it flows nicely with another child commenting that he can \u0026lsquo;see his willy\u0026rsquo;, David is naked, and the mother is mortified. I found it funny that the child mentions as they\u0026rsquo;re led away that \u0026lsquo;it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that big anyway.\u0026rsquo;\nDavid then wakes up among the wolves, who snarl at him. He gets out the pen unharmed though. I like how David\u0026rsquo;s voice is audibly nervous, given his confusion and the fact he\u0026rsquo;s naked.\nDavid later has a conversation with the same boy, hidden in a bush, while the boy gets him (once convinced) a coat stolen off a bench. Fairly like the film, just expanded. Again, it\u0026rsquo;s nice.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a town crier, too, a new addition. He\u0026rsquo;s calling the full moon murders, half-devoured, that of the \u0026rsquo;new Jack the Ripper.\u0026rsquo; Nice detail of media sensationalism.\nDavid then shows back up at Alex\u0026rsquo;s flat, and it\u0026rsquo;s like the film scene. David is not very lucid and is behaving similarly to a wolf in heat. He later laments that he feels \u0026rsquo;like an athlete.\u0026rsquo; I just find his interactions funny, if I\u0026rsquo;m honest.\nLater, in the same scene, David learns of the eight murders and gets cold feet while in the cab, and Alex follows him, concerned. One interesting, but minor detail changed is \u0026lsquo;Rational? I\u0026rsquo;m a fucking werewolf, for Christ\u0026rsquo;s sake,\u0026rsquo; which is changed in the for-radio adaptation to \u0026lsquo;Rational? I\u0026rsquo;m a freaking werewolf, for Christ\u0026rsquo;s sake.\u0026rsquo; This would consider that the adaptation was broadcasted on live radio, it\u0026rsquo;s just strange that line was censored while various sexual references and a full-on sex scene were not.\nAs we see in the porno theatre, the sound design once again shines. There\u0026rsquo;s the blaring sound of the porno playing while David converses with Jack and the eight victims. One thing that lets it down though, I\u0026rsquo;d say, is that Gerald, the businessman, delivers the line; \u0026lsquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve left my wife a widow and my children fatherless; And, I understand, I am to walk the earth in limbo – one of the living dead – until the wolf\u0026rsquo;s bloodline is severed and the curse lifted,\u0026rsquo; is less impactful in the audio drama versus the film. It feels rushed, unlike in the film where Mr Bringsley is audibly more hateful of David, his voice dripping with disdain much like his neck is with blood.\nHarry Berman and his fiancée, Judith Browns, are pretty much as jovial as they are in the film. Harry even jokes to David \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;d shake hands but you tore off my arm\u0026rsquo; in the same jovial manner. I love that addition in the audio drama.\nI love the added exposition that Dr Hirsch gives about the lycanthropic curse being of Eastern European origin, expanding on the lore and mentioning that his ancestors were from the same area and relied on superstition to survive. Alex questions the origin of the people of East Proctor, to which Dr Hirsch explains that 200 years ago they migrated from eastern Romania; It\u0026rsquo;s a great explanation of the origin of lycanthropy in the UK and raises questions such as how the curse survived in plain sight.\nThe ending between the made-for-radio audio adaptation and the original film is similar but distinct. While David is still killed at the end, George dares him to bite, before David is shot, in the audio adaptation. This is an interesting change, as in the film, Alex tries to coax David out gently before he pounces and gets shot.\nIn conclusion, the made-for-radio audio adaptation of \u0026lsquo;An American Werewolf in London\u0026rsquo; offers a fresh and immersive take on the classic horror-comedy film. While the original movie is a beloved classic, the audio adaptation distinguishes itself by expanding upon the narrative, character relationships, and lycanthropic lore. The sound design in the adaptation is particularly praiseworthy, effectively conveying the tension and horror throughout the story. It also pays attention to subtle details, such as animals sensing the supernatural and the characters\u0026rsquo; Jewish backgrounds, which add depth to the story.\nThe adaptation brings out the humanity of the characters, especially David, as it delves deeper into his struggle with the transformation and his relationship with his friend Jack. This exploration evokes empathy from the listener and adds another layer to the narrative. Additionally, the adaptation introduces new elements, such as a town crier reporting on the full moon murders, which contributes to the story\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere and world-building.\nWhile some elements of the adaptation differ from the original film, such as the final confrontation between David and George, these changes offer a unique perspective and contribute to the adaptation\u0026rsquo;s distinct charm. The pacing is a lot faster with the radio drama versus the film, which is a great change.\nIf given a star rating, I would give it a 4.5/5.\nIn summary, the \u0026lsquo;An American Werewolf in London\u0026rsquo; made-for-radio audio adaptation is a commendable and immersive rendition of the classic horror-comedy. It successfully captures the essence of the original while providing a fresh and engaging listening experience for fans and newcomers alike.\n","permalink":"https://ewancroft.uk/reviews/american-werewolf-radio-review/","summary":"My thoughts and review on the 1997 BBC Radio 1 adaptation of An American Werewolf in London.","title":"An American Werewolf in London made-for-radio BBC audio adaptation"},{"content":" 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 You would think That today’s world Would be more equal.

I beg of you, Jehovah, Yahweh, Jesus… I beg of you in the Fleeting moments, Of my human mind, Its final plea… The fur, already… Oh God… Once he takes hold, The Hyde to my Jekyll… I beg of thee, oh Father, Please don’t let The wolf hurt them. Panting, heaving… Barely conscious… Here we go, Father… He… He is me. I am here… You failed me, \u0026#34;Father.\u0026#34; That isn\u0026#39;t much of a surprise… The wolves always have ways To silence, to exterminate… We praise the Moon, it is our true master. It brings us what You deny… It lets us break free Freedom, escape from our chains… What the human was too afraid of. You abandoned us, faux God. You cursed Lycaon, You cursed us... The human doesn\u0026#39;t understand, We only want to be free… All of us, All of us, All of us, trapped. We can not hunt, We can not be free, We can not be with our own.
